	"content": " Introduction My theory, and it is only a theory, is that dietary biogenic amines pass from the gut into the bloodstream in between 60% and 100% of people, and not 1% as is the mainstream view.\nThis might seem like a minor detail of no real significance, but in fact it is hugely significant. If this theory is true, everything changes. The vast majority of foods available in a typical supermarket, including foods currently considered healthy, would instead be considered unhealthy and would probably end up being banned by governments. The entire processed food industry would be under threat. There would be an additional and major plausible explanation for the surge in chronic disease over the last 40 years or so and an additional and powerful course of action available to those who care about their health.\nGiven the significance of this point, I think that it is surprising that, as far as I can tell, it has rarely been studied. I could only find 2 very small studies about it on Pubmed (a repository of scientific studies). These, taken together, suggest that biogenic amines do pass into the bloodstream in between 60% and 100% of people.\nLet me explain.\n"

	"content": " Histamine Intolerance - What is accepted by the mainstream. Let me start with an overview of histamine intolerance - a condition I personally suffer from - because it sets out what is accepted by the mainstream scientists and doctors.\nHistamine intolerance is an officially-recognised condition that is based on the following 3 accepted facts.\n Many modern foods, unlike those eaten by our ancestors, contain relatively large quantities of histamine and other so-called \u0026lsquo;biogenic amines\u0026rsquo; - molecules that are used internally as a signalling chemical for various purposes by many species including humans. The majority of methods that allow foods to have a longer shelf life and be available out of season cause biogenic amines to be created in the foods. If the histamine and other biogenic amines were to pass from the foods in our digestive systems into the blood stream, it would be expected to cause health issues because various parts of the body would respond to their signalling effects but the signalling would be unwanted because it had come from foods and not from the body\u0026rsquo;s own signalling mechanisms. Biogenic amines are known to be involved in stimulating inflammation, pulling calcium out of bones, regulating the sleep-wake cycle and regulating digestion. The digestive system neutralizes the biogenic amines with a chemical called DAO so that they do not pass into the blood stream and do not cause these signalling problems. But in 1% of people, this neutralization process is inadequate and biogenic amines do pass into the bloodstream and do cause signalling problems and corresponding health problems.  It is this final part that is wrong according to my theory. It is instead between 60% and 100% of people that cannot neutralize all of the biogenic amines in food that is not completely fresh and this leads to one or more of: chronic inflammation, calcium metabolism disorders, digestive disorders and sleep disorders. Chronic inflammation then contributes strongly to one or more of: weight gain, heart disease, cancer, auto-immune diseases and cognitive diseases.\n"

	"content": "Given the enormous repercussions should it be the case that biogenic amines in food do pass into the bloodstream of most people, it is surprisingly hard to find any evidence one way or the other. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to have been studied much.\nI suspect this is because, as only about 1% of people show symptoms of histamine intolerance, it is simply assumed that everyone else is able to fully neutralize biogenic amines. But as biogenic amines attach to cells in the body (this is how they carry out their signalling function) it is possible that in most people the biogenic amines get attached to cells in the heart, arteries and osteoclasts or other receptors, such that the person doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel anything but nevertheless in time develops diseases. It is well-established that chronic inflammation is associated with a wide range of diseases but people developing these diseases do not feel the inflammation. For example, the accumulation of plaque in people\u0026rsquo;s arteries is associated with chronic inflammation yet people do not feel at all unwell until, after decades of plaque accumulation, they have a heart attack. They do not feel the inflammation. That\u0026rsquo;s why people have blood tests to test for inflammation - if they could feel it they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t need the test. So biogenic amines could plausibly be passing into the blood stream of most people without them feeling unwell, depending on which cells the biogenic amines mainly attached to.\nIf this were the case then histamine intolerance would probably be better characterised as a predisposition in some people for the biogenic amines to attach to receptors that produce noticeable short-term problems rather than problems that are unnoticeable in the short and medium term.\nOne study did test whether histamine, at a normal level found in food, passed into normal people\u0026rsquo;s bloodstreams. It only looked at 10 people unfortunately (plus 10 controls) so is too small a study to draw any concrete conclusions from, but it found that in 5 of the 10 people the histamine did appear to have passed into their bloodstreams as they had noticeable reactions to it whereas none of the controls had any reaction. So this 50% of the sample does massively contradict the mainstream view that only 1% of people can\u0026rsquo;t fully neutralize dietary biogenic amines.\nAn interesting thing to note from this study is that none of the blood tests taken from the subjects (presumably taken from the arm) showed any raised histamine level, even in the subjects that had a noticeable histamine reaction. This suggests that all the molecules of histamine that did get into the bloodstream had attached to a cell receptor before the blood got to the arm. This might offer another explanation of why the mainstream view is that only 1% of people can\u0026rsquo;t fully neutralize the dietary biogenic amines - any studies conducted by giving subjects a dose of histamine and then looking for changes in blood levels of histamine would find no raised histamine level and then conclude that there was no histamine passing into the bloodstream.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": " The Fresh Food Diet This is a diet based on a combination of:\n Several fairly widely-accepted, although not exactly mainstream, concepts about the recent rise of obesity and other chronic illnesses. An entirely unproven theory of my own about biogenic amines that I\u0026rsquo;ve never heard anyone else suggest, is contradictory to mainstream theory and is therefore quite possibly wrong. A \u0026lsquo;broken mechanism\u0026rsquo;-based approach to looking at obesity and other diseases of industrialisation. Again, this is my own approach and in some aspects it is somewhat contrary to mainstream theory and in others it is more in line.  It mainly involves eating fresh food, but what constitutes fresh is quite strict - some foods considered fresh by many people are forbidden.\nIt does not involve going hungry - it is not a calorie-controlled diet; you can eat as much as you like. But it does require self-discipline, at least initially, because for most people it probably involves a complete change of eating habits, more difficultly shopping, more time spent cooking and the foregoing of many compelling foods.\nIt also involves various other behaviours which I consider healthy.\nI personally follow this diet and it seems to work for me. According to my genetic analysis on the website 23andMe.com, I am predisposed to weigh 190 pounds (86kg, 13 stone 8) whereas I actually weigh 145 pounds (66kg, 10 stone 5). According to an MRI scan I have zero detectable calcified plaque in my heart and arteries, and my blood test levels for inflammation are always low.\nWhether it works for anyone else or not - I don\u0026rsquo;t know. But I wanted to set out my diet in case anyone else wants to try it or might find it interesting. But if anyone does, please note The Mother Of All Disclaimers.\nAlso, it is a low histamine diet, so anyone who, like me, has histamine intolerance, may find it interesting.\n"

	"content": "There was also a study of pigs where they gave some pigs a dose of histamine and some of the pigs also were given a substance to block their production of DAO. DAO is what pigs (and humans) naturally produce to neutralise biogenic amines such as histamine in their digestive systems to stop it going into their bloodstreams. The pigs with the blocked DAO production had severely raised levels of histamine in their blood. Although this isn\u0026rsquo;t in itself surprising, the authors noted that 20% of humans eat or drink things that similarly block DAO production and so they suggested that histamine from food getting into the bloodstream in humans is likely to be a problem.\nBoth this pig study and the human study discussed previously are very small and so you can\u0026rsquo;t draw very solid conclusions from them. But I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any other studies on the subject.\nMy estimate of 60% to 100% of humans being unable to stop biogenic amines in food from getting into their bloodstreams comes from these studies so it\u0026rsquo;s really a very wild guess. The 60% is made up of the 50% of humans that had reactions to the histamine in the human study, plus 20% of the remaining 50% who might be taking DOA inhibiting substances.\nThe 100% is based on the possibility that no humans can stop all biogenic amines getting into their blood streams and the reason that the 50% in the human study didn\u0026rsquo;t show any reaction is that the histamine molecules all attached to cells whose response couldn\u0026rsquo;t be felt, such as cells in the heart and artery walls and cells in osteoclasts.\nI also think that it is possible that the length of time that humans have been consuming the specific foods with biogenic amines matters. For example, if you hang beef for a few days prior to eating it then it becomes more tender apparently. This is a practice that is done today and could easily have been done for thousands of years. It\u0026rsquo;s not rocket science to hang an animal from a tree after killing it. There is some evidence that humans do produce DAO on eating beef and beef is one of the foods best tolerated by people with histamine intolerance. So I think that it\u0026rsquo;s possible that we\u0026rsquo;ve evolved to produce DAO on eating beef whereas if we eat, for example, a ready meal that is full of biogenic amines then we don\u0026rsquo;t produce enough DAO because the body isn\u0026rsquo;t expecting it to contain biogenic amines.\n"

Each rule is covered in more detail on this website, including many exceptions to the rules.\n Tinned/canned/jarred foods are forbidden. Foods that are kept fresh by the packaging, such as using a modified atmosphere, are forbidden. Foods with an ingredients list of more than 1 item are forbidden. Foods that have been frozen for more than 2 weeks are forbidden. Artificially ripened foods are forbidden. In practice this means that foods must be either (i) local and in-season, or (ii) organic, from a country that is fairly close and in-season in that country. Foods that require a preparation process that has only become available within the last 200 years are forbidden. Foods with a shelf life of more than a month, except where they are completely dry, or are entirely either fat or sugar are forbidden. Fermented foods are forbidden except for one day a week to help support a healthy microbiome. Smoked foods are forbidden. Everything else is allowed.  It may seem like hardly anything is allowed on the diet, but that is really more of a reflection of the state the world has got to where only processed and long-life foods are eaten.\nYou can eat fresh in-season fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, shellfish, eggs, butter, cream, home-made bone stock, grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, olive oil, coconut oil and seaweed. Once a week you can eat bread, cheese, chocolate, yogurt, pickles and sauerkraut. You can eat at restaurants where they cook local in-season food from fresh. Sugar, particularly brown sugar or molasses, in moderation is allowed so you can eat home-made desserts. People ate these foods quite happily for thousands of years until recently and the enormous diversity of world cuisines evolved from eating only these foods.\n"
