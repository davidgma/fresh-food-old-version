## Micronutrients

Getting all your required micronutrients is part of this diet. As part of my broken mechanism approach to understanding diseases of industrialisation, is seems plausible to me that all of the body's mechanisms will need the basic building blocks of micronutrients to work properly. In any case, it is clear that getting sufficient micronutrients is necessary for good health.

In general, if you are eating a balanced diet containing at least vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, and eggs, I think it likely that you will be ok. But it's a good idea to, from time to time, weigh and record everything you eat in nutrition software. I use [cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) which is free, but there are many choices. By doing this you can get a better idea of whether or not your diet is covering all the necessary nutrients.

One nutrient that generally isn't covered in nutrition software but is very important is iodine. Some studies have suggested that iodine deficiency is a widespread problem even in developed countries like Britain. I think it's a good idea to include some arame dried seaweed in your diet. I add a small amount to soups - just a few shreds, maybe 0.1g. There is a danger of taking in too much iodine, although some scientists say that this is only an issue from artificial sources of iodine, such as pills, and that you can eat seaweed without any danger. I don't know, you may want to do some research, but about 0.1g of arame dried seaweed no more than once a day is what I do. You can use other seaweeds but it's worth checking on the internet how much iodine they contain. Some, like the nori seaweed used to make sushi, contains almost none while others can contain a huge amount.
