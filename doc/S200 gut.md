## Maintaining a healthy gut lining

Similar to maintaining a health microbiome, this is an area where scientists have established that it's important but don't have much to say with any certainty about exactly what you need to do.

Maintaining a healthy microbiome is probably the most important thing you can do to keep your gut healthy as the two are closely linked.

Hopefully one day more will be known about how to do this.

Eating a lot of sugar and other refined carbohydrates is almost certainly very bad for your gut lining, as it is for your microbiome, so this should be avoided. 

Eating a balanced diet is probably the safest bet for now. I think that a balanced diet should probably include all the following elements:

1. Very small amounts of home-fermented vegetables (about 10 grams) at most meals.
2. Some raw salad leaves e.g. rocket/watercress, about 20 grams a day.
3. A source of calcium e.g. cooked and softened chicken bones (about 4 grams per day) or dairy products.
4. Quality fat e.g. goose or duck fat/tallow/olive oil/coconut oil/butter.
5. A complete protein e.g. meat/fish/seafood/eggs, at least 100 grams cooked weight at most or all meals.
6. A starchy carbohydrate e.g. oats/brown rice/potatoes, at least 100 grams cooked weight at most or all meals.
7. Non-starchy vegetables, cooked e.g. red peppers/cauliflower/onions etc etc etc, at least 300 grams raw weight at most meals.
8. Seasoning, herbs and spices e.g. salt/pepper/curry powder/mixed herbs.
9. An iodine source e.g. kombu seaweed, about half of a gram of dried seaweed per day, depending on the seaweed.
10. Some fruit, raw e.g. berries/apple/currants, at least 80 grams raw weight at most meals.
11. Some nuts or seeds e.g. pistachios, but not much as they can contain a lot of histamine. About 10 grams per day.
