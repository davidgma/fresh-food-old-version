## The Fresh Food Rules

These are the rules for what counts as genuinely fresh food. More details are given further down (at least they hopefully will be - this is work-in-progress), including many exceptions to the rules.

1. Tinned/canned/jarred foods are forbidden.
1. Foods that are kept fresh by the packaging, such as using a modified atmosphere, are forbidden.
1. Foods with an ingredients list of more than 1 item are forbidden.
1. Foods that have been frozen for more than 2 weeks are forbidden.
1. Artificially ripened foods are forbidden. In practice this means that foods must be either (i) local and in-season, or (ii) organic, from a country that is fairly close and in-season in that country.
1. Foods that require a preparation process that has only become available within the last 200 years are forbidden.
1. Foods with a shelf life of more than a month, except where they are completely dry, or are entirely either fat or sugar, are forbidden.
1. Fermented foods are forbidden except in small quantities. 
1. Smoked foods are forbidden.
1. Everything else is allowed.

It may seem like hardly anything is allowed on the diet, but that is really more of a reflection of the state the world has got to where only processed and long-life foods are eaten.

You can eat fresh in-season fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, shellfish, eggs, butter, cream, home-made bone stock, grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, olive oil, coconut oil and seaweed. You can eat small amounts of pickles or sauerkraut at any meal. You can eat at restaurants where they cook local in-season food from fresh. Sugar, particularly brown sugar or molasses, in moderation is allowed so you can eat home-made desserts. People ate these foods quite happily for thousands of years until recently and the enormous diversity of world cuisines evolved from eating only these foods.
