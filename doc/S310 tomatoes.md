## Tomatoes

Tomatoes are often listed on sites about histamine intolerance as being foods to avoid. I think that this is because they tend to be ethylene ripened. But it's generally possible to buy tomatoes all year round, at least in Britain, that are not ethylene ripened and are allowed on the diet.

If the tomato is local (e.g. from Britain if you live in Britain) and organic, it should be ok because ethylene ripening isn't allowed for most organic foods. I buy the ones that are small and on the vine and have no problems with them.
