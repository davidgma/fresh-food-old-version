## Maintaining a healthy microbiome

Your microbiome is the set of microbes such as bacteria and yeast that co-exist with you - mainly in your digestive system but also on your skin, in your mouth, up your nose etc. Research on this subject has been mushrooming recently and the findings are that your microbiome is incredibly important for your health.

For example, there is compelling evidence that your microbes effect your weight. There have been experiments where they took microbes from the guts of thin mice and put them into the guts of fat mice and the fat mice became a lot thinner. There is also compelling evidence that your microbes effect your brain functioning, your immune system, your digestive system and provide vital nutrients to your body.

As a result of all this research, advice to maintain a healthy microbiome has now become fairly mainstream. Unfortunately, the research has yet to come up with much in the way of helpful recommendations on how to do this. So I've included this requirement as part of the diet more in the hope that one day it will be clearer what needs to be done rather than because there's much that can be done about it with any certainty now.

It is clear from the research that, to have a healthy microbiome, it is a good idea to be born naturally rather than by a caesarian delivery, it is good to be fed breast milk rather than formula as a baby and to avoid having your appendix removed. If you can live as a hunter-gather on the plains of Africa, so much the better. But for most people, including me, all this advice isn't terribly helpful. 

Taking probiotics is sometimes suggested, but I think that even this is coming under dispute by some researchers. At most it might make a difference for a couple of weeks but once you stop taking them your microbiome will most probably go back to how it was before. Some probiotics may even make any problems with biogenic amines worse because the microbes in them produce biogenic amines as part of their metabolism.

Exercising appears to be good for your microbiome but you should be doing that anyway.

Regularly eating fermented foods like yoghurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles or kombucha might help. But then again, most store-bought yoghurt doesn't contain any live bacteria. The same is true for sauerkraut if it doesn't state on the label that it is raw (otherwise they pasteurise it and this kills off the very bacteria that may or may not be beneficial). Pickles are often just made with vinegar rather than traditionally fermented I think. Kombucha still contains quite a bit of sugar I think. And no-one really understands what the microbes in these foods do to you or if they do anything at all. And all these fermented foods contain high concentrations of biogenic amines. But then again, some traditional peoples, such as hunter-gatherer-horticulturists, who have very good health, eat small amounts of fermented food.

So I don't really know what is best. Personally, I try to eat a variety of different foods including vegetables and fruit (changing with the seasons), sprouted beans and grains, meat, fish, eggs, butter, cream, olive oil, moderate amounts of alcohol and sometimes small amounts of fermented foods such as 10-20 g of sauerkraut with a meal. It's best to do the fermenting yourself if you can, otherwise make sure you buy raw products. I also try to not eat too much sugar and mostly avoid white flour as I think that these can possibly lead to an imbalance in your microbiome if you eat too much of them.

Hopefully one day scientists will be able to make better suggestions on what is needed for your microbiome.
