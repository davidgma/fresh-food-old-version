## Occam's Razor

Occam's Razor is a philosophical principal that says that the explanation that requires the fewest assumptions is usually correct.

Most, if not all, of the so-called diseases of industrialisation can be explained by just one assumption: that the body does not fully stop dietary biogenic amines from passing into the blood stream.

Biogenic amines have such an extensive signalling role within the body, including causing inflammation and regulating calcium, the circadian rhythm, digestion and cognition, that an enormous range of modern diseases could be explained by this one assumption.

So although Occam's Razor isn't a proof that my theory is right, it does suggest that it may well be.
