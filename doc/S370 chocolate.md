## Chocolate

Chocolate is really bad unfortunately and isn't allowed on the diet. If I eat it, it makes me ill for a few days. Nevertheless I do eat it sometimes just because I'm quite addicted to it and it's so delicious. I invariably regret it afterwards.

If you must eat chocolate, I would recommend not doing so more than once a month.
