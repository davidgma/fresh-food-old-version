## Meat and fish

This is one of the most important parts because biogenic amines grow very quickly in foods high in protein and techniques that supermarkets use to give them a longer shelf life allow biogenic amines to increase yet the food appears to be fresh.

Meat and fish can only come from an actual butcher or fishmonger, or the butcher or fishmonger counter at a supermarket, and where the food hasn't been previously frozen.

The meat and fish available ready-packed on the shelves in supermarkets is forbidden on this diet. The packaging stops aerobic bacteria from multiplying and so the food seems fresh. But anaerobic bacteria continue to multiply and produce biogenic amines.

Tinned and frozen meat and fish is prohibited on this diet. Meat and fish bought fresh in accordance with the requirements above can be frozen at home, but must be eaten within 2 weeks, ideally within 1 week.

As noted in the section on freezing foods, liver, while nutritious, is best avoided except on rare occasions, because biogenic amines accumulate really fast in it. It's almost impossible to get it sufficiently fresh in the modern world.

Seafood (e.g. shellfish) also accumulates biogenic amines very quickly. You have to make sure it's fresh that morning, or ideally still alive (e.g. for oysters, mussels, crab and langoustines sometimes).

Salmon also accumulates biogenic amines very quickly and so ideally salmon should be sashimi grade (you can still cook it).
