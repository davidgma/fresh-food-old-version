## The List of Very Safe Foods

The following foods are particularly safe to eat. The rules still apply about them needing to be fresh (they can't be tinned, frozen, pickled, packed in a protective or sealed environment, vacuum-packed, preserved, ethylene ripened (so they should be local, in-season and ideally organic), dried (apart from grains, sugar, herbs and spices), pre-cooked or pre-processed). See the [practice][practice] and [fresh rules][fresh_rules] sections of this document for more details).

They are suitable for the 3-day test.

The list is based on my own experience, [this food compatibility list][foodcompat] and [this survey data][survey].

Note that The Fresh Food Diet is by no means limited to just these foods. Any foods complying with the rules are allowed. These are just particularly safe foods. These foods could be used as the starting point for an elimination diet. Start with just these foods and then try introducing other foods (still following the rules for The Fresh Food Diet) and see if they cause any issues.
