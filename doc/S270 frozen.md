## Frozen Foods

Any food that has been frozen for more that 2 weeks is prohibited on this diet.

There doesn't seem to be any clear scientific evidence one way or the other for frozen foods. Most scientific literature says that freezing 'inhibits' the production of biogenic amines, or that foods can be frozen to 'minimize' the formation of biogenic amines. They almost never say whether freezing stops the formation of biogenic amines altogether or whether it just happens really slowly in frozen foods.  

I did find one report that said '[Freezing and frozen storage (−18 °C) will stop the growth of all bacteria and further formation of histamine.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4921096/)', but this was the exception. Another report for example said '[freezing can clearly prevent or slow down the process](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16260192)'. 

Although not a scientific study, [this website on histamine intolerance](https://www.histaminintoleranz.ch/en/therapy_cookingadvice.html) says 'Freezing at –18º C slows down these processes even more strongly but still cannot stop them entirely. Therefore even frozen food should not be stored longer than necessary.' But many other sites on histamine intolerance say that eating frozen food is fine.

It's also hard to find any scientific studies that actually measure the levels of biogenic amines in foods that have been frozen for long periods of time. 

Even if, at the temperatures of domestic and supermarket freezers (−18 °C), no biogenic amines are formed, there are a lot of risks. The temperature of the freezer may have risen in the past due to a power cut, faulty equipment or a fraudulent money-saving ploy by the commercial freezing company. And where a food was commercially frozen, you don't know how old it was when initially frozen.

There's a US government site called the [Cold Food Storage Chart](https://www.foodsafety.gov/food-safety-charts/cold-food-storage-charts) which recommends quite short freezer storage times relative to what you might expect if there was absolutely no change in frozen foods. Some of the maximum freezer storage times, at −18 °C (0 °F), are as little as 1 month. This suggests that changes can happen in frozen foods over time.

My own personal experience as someone with histamine intolerance is that frozen foods do contain histamine or other biogenic amines. I've tested them myself and consistently reacted to them. I've bought and cooked frozen food from the supermarket several times and reacted to it. On one occasion, I bought some fresh chicken livers, ate half of them straight away and had no reaction at all, chopped up and froze the other half for about a week, then ate them, cooking them straight from frozen (but I cooked them thoroughly). I did react to these.  

So while the scientific evidence suggests that frozen food might be ok, it's not clear and my personal experience is otherwise. At least until more is known about them in relation to biogenic amines, they will be prohibited on this diet.

When buying fresh meat or fish at the butcher's or fishmonger's counters of a supermarket, or at a butcher or fishmonger, check whether the food has been previously frozen (and then defrosted). They should be able to tell you. Sometimes it has been, particularly with fish. If it has been previously frozen, it is not allowed on this diet. In general, locally farmed fish has usually not been previously frozen. For example in the UK, UK-farmed salmon and UK-farmed rainbow trout has rarely been previously frozen. 

An exception to this rule is sashimi-grade fish, which is previously frozen for a day or so to kill some parasites and make it safer to eat. But it is allowed on this diet. In fact, if you can afford it and have a good local supplier, I recommend buying sashimi-grade fish even if you are going to cook it. You should cook and eat it the same day that you buy it. It undergoes a higher level of careful handling than normal fish and I have never had any reactions to sashimi-grade salmon that I've bought at a reputable fishmonger and cooked the same day. I once reacted to sashimi salmon in the Yo Sushi on Finchley Road, London, but it actually smelt quite strongly (whereas really fresh fish shouldn't smell very strongly) so I don't think that they had stored it properly and I should have sent it back. I never went there again. I've eaten sashimi fish in Yo Sushi many other times in other branches and never had any trouble.

Another exception is liver, which I don't recommend eating from frozen at all, even if you freeze it yourself from fresh and eat it after a week. Even eating it fresh is quite risky as biogenic amines accumulate very fast in liver. Hunter-gatherers traditionally cook and eat the liver of animals immediately after killing them whereas the rest of the animal is taken back home first. I don't know why this is exactly, but I suspect it's because liver is very healthy when eaten fresh but develops biogenic amines so quickly that by the time they got it home it wouldn't be safe to eat.
