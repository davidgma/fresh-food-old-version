## Frozen Foods

Any food that has been frozen for more that 2 weeks is prohibited on this diet.

There doesn't seem to be clear scientific evidence one way or the other for frozen foods. Most scientific literature says that freezing 'inhibits' the production of biogenic amines, or that foods can be frozen to 'minimize' the formation of biogenic amines. They almost never say whether freezing stops the formation of biogenic amines altogether or whether it just happens really slowly in frozen foods.  

I did find one report that said '[Freezing and frozen storage (−18 °C) will stop the growth of all bacteria and further formation of histamine.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4921096/)', but this was the exception. Another report for example said '[freezing can clearly prevent or slow down the process](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16260192)'. 

Although not a scientific study, [this website on histamine intolerance](https://www.histaminintoleranz.ch/en/therapy_cookingadvice.html) says 'Freezing at –18º C slows down these processes even more strongly but still cannot stop them entirely. Therefore even frozen food should not be stored longer than necessary.'

It's also hard to find any scientific studies that actually measure the levels of biogenic amines in foods that have been frozen for long periods of time.

Even if, at the temperatures of domestic and supermarket freezers (−18 °C) no biogenic amines are formed, there are a lot of risks. The temperature of the freezer may have risen in the past due to a power cut, faulty equipment or a fraudulent money-saving ploy by the commercial freezing company.

My own personal experience as someone with histamine intolerance, is that frozen foods do contain histamine or other biogenic amines. I've tested them myself and consistently reacted to them. I've bought frozen food from the supermarket several times and reacted to it. On one occasion, I bought some fresh chicken livers, ate half of them straight away and had no reaction at all, chopped up and froze the other half for about a week, then ate them, cooking them straight from frozen (but I cooked them thoroughly). I did react to these frozen livers.  

So while the scientific evidence does suggest that frozen food should be ok, my experience is otherwise.
