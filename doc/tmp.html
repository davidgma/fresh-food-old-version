<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This is a diet based on a combination of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Several fairly widely-accepted, although not exactly mainstream, concepts about the recent rise of obesity and other chronic illnesses.</li>
<li>An entirely unproven theory of my own about biogenic amines that I've never heard anyone else suggest. It is contrary to mainstream theory.</li>
</ol>
<p>It mainly involves eating fresh food, but what constitutes fresh is quite strict - some foods considered fresh by many people are forbidden.</p>
<p>It does not involve going hungry - it is not a calorie-controlled diet; you can eat as much as you like. But it does require self-discipline, at least initially, because for most people it probably involves a complete change of eating habits, more difficultly shopping, more time spent cooking and the foregoing of many compelling foods.</p>
<p>It also involves various other behaviours which I consider healthy.</p>
<p>I personally follow this diet and it seems to work for me. According to my genetic analysis on the website <a href="https://www.23andme.com">23andMe.com</a>, I am predisposed to weigh 190 pounds (86kg, 13 stone 8) whereas I actually weigh 150 pounds (68kg, 10 stone 10). According to an MRI scan I have zero detectable calcified plaque in my heart and arteries, and my blood test levels for inflammation are always low.</p>
<p>Whether it works for anyone else or not - I don't know. But I wanted to set out my diet in case anyone else wants to try it or might find it interesting. But if anyone does, please note <a href="#disclaimer">The Mother Of All Disclaimers</a>.</p>
<p>Also, it is a low histamine/low biogenic amine diet, so anyone who, like me, has histamine intolerance, may find it interesting.</p>
