<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This is a diet based on a combination of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Several fairly widely-accepted, although not exactly mainstream, concepts about the recent rise of obesity and other chronic illnesses.</li>
<li>An entirely unproven theory of my own about biogenic amines that I've never heard anyone else suggest. It is contrary to mainstream theory.</li>
</ol>
<p>It mainly involves eating fresh food, but what constitutes fresh is quite strict - some foods considered fresh by many people are forbidden.</p>
<p>It does not involve going hungry - it is not a calorie-controlled diet; you can eat as much as you like. But it does require self-discipline, at least initially, because for most people it probably involves a complete change of eating habits, more difficultly shopping, more time spent cooking and the foregoing of many compelling foods.</p>
<p>It also involves various other behaviours which I consider healthy.</p>
<p>I personally follow this diet and it seems to work for me. According to my genetic analysis on the website <a href="https://www.23andme.com">23andMe.com</a>, I am predisposed to weigh 190 pounds (86kg, 13 stone 8) whereas I actually weigh 150 pounds (68kg, 10 stone 10). According to an MRI scan I have zero detectable calcified plaque in my heart and arteries, and my blood test levels for inflammation are always low.</p>
<p>Whether it works for anyone else or not - I don't know. But I wanted to set out my diet in case anyone else wants to try it or might find it interesting. But if anyone does, please note <a href="#disclaimer">The Mother Of All Disclaimers</a>.</p>
<p>Also, it is a low histamine/low biogenic amine diet, so anyone who, like me, has histamine intolerance, may find it interesting.</p>

<h2 id="the-main-diet-rules">The Main Diet Rules</h2>
<p>These are the main rules to follow for the diet.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure you get all the required micronutrients in your diet.</li>
<li>Avoid foods that cause compulsive eating.</li>
<li>Maintain a healthy microbiome.</li>
<li>Eat only foods that are genuinely fresh, as defined in this diet.</li>
<li>Get enough exercise.</li>
<li>Get some exposure to the sun at least a few times during the year at a safe level but without sunblock or moisturiser.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-fresh-food-rules">The Fresh Food Rules</h2>
<p>These are the rules for what counts as genuinely fresh food. More details are given further down (at least they hopefully will be - this is work-in-progress), including many exceptions to the rules.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tinned/canned/jarred foods are forbidden.</li>
<li>Foods that are kept fresh by the packaging, such as using a modified atmosphere, are forbidden.</li>
<li>Pre-packaged foods with an ingredients list of more than 1 item are forbidden (e.g. ready meals).</li>
<li>Foods that have been frozen for more than 2 weeks are forbidden.</li>
<li>Artificially ripened foods are forbidden. In practice this means that foods must be either (i) local and in-season, or (ii) organic, from a country that is fairly close and in-season in that country.</li>
<li>Foods that require a preparation process that has only become available within the last 200 years are forbidden.</li>
<li>Foods with a shelf life of more than a month, except where they are completely dry, or are entirely either fat or sugar, are forbidden.</li>
<li>Fermented foods are forbidden except in small quantities.</li>
<li>Smoked foods are forbidden.</li>
<li>Everything else is allowed.</li>
</ol>
<p>It may seem like hardly anything is allowed on the diet, but that is really more of a reflection of the state the world has got to where only processed and long-life foods are eaten.</p>
<p>You can eat fresh in-season fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, shellfish, eggs, butter, cream, home-made bone stock, grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, olive oil, coconut oil and seaweed. You can eat small amounts of pickles or sauerkraut at any meal. You can eat at restaurants where they cook local in-season food from fresh. Sugar, particularly brown sugar or molasses, in moderation is allowed so you can eat home-made desserts. People ate these foods quite happily for thousands of years until recently and the enormous diversity of world cuisines evolved from eating only these foods.</p>
<h1 id="theory">Theory</h1>
<p>This section sets out the theories behind the main diet rules and the fresh food rules.</p>
<p>You don't need to read any of this if you aren't interested. You can skip to the practical details further down.</p>
<p>In the past 200 or so years, and especially in the past 40 years, there has been a huge increase in certain diseases. They broadly fit into the following categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some cancers</li>
<li>Cardiovascular diseases (e.g. heart disease and stroke)</li>
<li>Metabolic syndrome diseases (e.g. weight gain, obesity, diabetes)</li>
<li>Autoimmune diseases</li>
<li>Cognitive diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's Disease)</li>
<li>Neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g. eating disorders, schizophrenia, depression)</li>
</ol>
<p>These diseases are sometimes collectively called the 'diseases of industrialization'. Many of them could equally well be called the diseases of inflammation as chronic inflammation is common to many of them.</p>
<p>Researchers have been trying to work out why this has happened, and they are still not sure. All that is known for sure is that we went from eating fresh, local, in-season produce, prepared in our own kitchens, to eating food with long shelf lives that have been produced and prepared elsewhere. Most researchers, as far as I can tell, agree that some aspects of this have caused the problems. But no one really knows exactly what the aspects are, advice on what to do has been astoundingly unsuccessful and there isn't really a very good explanation for exactly what is causing the chronic inflammation.</p>
<p>My theory is that the chronic inflammation, as well as various other problems, are caused by dietary biogenic amines passing from the digestive system into the bloodstream. This is contrary to mainstream theory which says that dietary biogenic amines are fully neutralised in the digestive system.</p>
<h2 id="biogenic-amines---my-theory">Biogenic Amines - My Theory</h2>
<p>So my theory, and it is only a theory, is that dietary biogenic amines pass from the digestive system into the bloodstream in between 60% and 100% of people, and not <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/85/5/1185/4633007">1%</a> as is the mainstream view.</p>
<p>This might seem like a minor detail of no real significance, but in fact it is hugely significant. If this theory is true, everything changes. The vast majority of foods available in a typical supermarket, including foods currently considered healthy, would instead be considered unhealthy and would probably end up being banned by governments. The entire processed food industry would be under threat. There would be an additional and major plausible explanation for the surge in chronic disease over the last 40 years or so and an additional and powerful course of action available to those who care about their health.</p>
<p>Given the significance of this point, I think that it is surprising that, as far as I can tell, it has rarely been studied. I could only find 2 very small studies about it on Pubmed (a repository of scientific studies). These, taken together, suggest that biogenic amines do pass into the bloodstream in between 60% and 100% of people.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<h2 id="histamine-intolerance">Histamine Intolerance</h2>
<p>Let me start with an overview of histamine intolerance - a condition I personally suffer from - because it sets out what is accepted by the mainstream scientists and doctors.</p>
<p>Histamine intolerance is an officially-recognised condition that is based on the following 3 accepted facts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Many modern foods, unlike those eaten by our ancestors, contain relatively large quantities of histamine and other so-called 'biogenic amines' - molecules that are used internally as a signalling chemical for various purposes by many species including humans. The majority of methods that allow foods to have a longer shelf life and be available out of season cause biogenic amines to be created in the foods. The biogenic amines are created as a by-product of microbial activity and increase over time; when the food is first harvested/killed it contains negligible quantities of biogenic amines.</li>
<li>If the histamine and other biogenic amines were to pass from the foods in our digestive systems into the blood stream, it would be expected to cause health issues because various parts of the body would respond to their signalling effects but the signalling would be unwanted because it had come from foods and not from the body's own signalling mechanisms. Biogenic amines are known to be involved in stimulating inflammation, pulling calcium out of bones, regulating the sleep-wake cycle, mediating neuronal signalling and regulating digestion.</li>
<li>The digestive system neutralizes the biogenic amines with a chemical called DAO so that they do not pass into the blood stream and do not cause these signalling problems. But in 1% of people, this neutralization process is inadequate and biogenic amines do pass into the bloodstream and do cause signalling problems and corresponding health problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is this final part that is wrong according to my theory. It is instead between 60% and 100% of people that cannot neutralize all of the biogenic amines in food and this leads to a large variety of potential health problems including chronic inflammation, calcium metabolism disorders, digestive disorders and sleep disorders. Chronic inflammation then contributes strongly to one or more of: weight gain, heart disease, cancer, auto-immune diseases and cognitive diseases.</p>
<h2 id="the-human-study">The Human study</h2>
<p>Given the enormous repercussions should it be the case that biogenic amines in food do pass into the bloodstream of most people, it is surprisingly hard to find any evidence one way or the other. It doesn't seem to have been studied much.</p>
<p>I suspect this is because, as only about 1% of people show symptoms of histamine intolerance, it is simply assumed that everyone else is able to fully neutralize biogenic amines. But as biogenic amines attach to cells in the body (this is how they carry out their signalling function) it is possible that in most people the biogenic amines get attached to cells in the heart, arteries and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2671373/">osteoclasts</a> or other receptors, such that the person doesn't feel anything but nevertheless in time develops diseases. It is well-established that chronic inflammation is associated with a wide range of diseases but people developing these diseases do not feel the inflammation. For example, the accumulation of plaque in people's arteries is associated with chronic inflammation yet people do not feel at all unwell until, after decades of plaque accumulation, they have a heart attack. They do not feel the inflammation. That's why people have blood tests to test for inflammation - if they could feel it they wouldn't need the test. So biogenic amines could plausibly be passing into the blood stream of most people without them feeling unwell, depending on which cells the biogenic amines mainly attached to.</p>
<p>If this were the case then histamine intolerance would probably be better characterised as a predisposition in some people for the biogenic amines to attach to receptors that produce noticeable short-term problems rather than problems that are unnoticeable in the short and medium term.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15603203">One study</a> did test whether histamine, at a normal level found in food, passed into normal people's bloodstreams. It only looked at 10 people unfortunately (plus 10 controls) so is too small a study to draw any concrete conclusions from, but it found that in 5 of the 10 people the histamine did appear to have passed into their bloodstreams as they had noticeable reactions to it whereas none of the controls had any reaction. So this 50% of the sample does massively contradict the mainstream view that only 1% of people can't fully neutralize dietary biogenic amines.</p>
<p>An interesting thing to note from this study is that none of the blood tests taken from the subjects (presumably taken from the arm) showed any raised histamine level, even in the subjects that had a noticeable histamine reaction. This suggests that all the molecules of histamine that did get into the bloodstream had attached to a cell receptor before the blood got to the arm. This might offer another explanation of why the mainstream view is that only 1% of people can't fully neutralize the dietary biogenic amines - any studies conducted by giving subjects a dose of histamine and then looking for changes in blood levels of histamine would find no raised histamine level and then conclude that there was no histamine passing into the bloodstream.</p>
<h2 id="the-pig-study">The Pig study</h2>
<p>There was also a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3134804">study of pigs</a> where they gave some pigs a dose of histamine and some of the pigs also were given a substance to block their production of DAO. DAO is what pigs (and humans) naturally produce to neutralise biogenic amines such as histamine in their digestive systems to stop it going into their bloodstreams.</p>
<p>When I say that humans are able to produce DAO it may seem that I am contradicting my theory. However, my theory is that humans are only able to neutralise biogenic amines in foods that they have evolved eating in a form that contains biogenic amines, such as red meat that has been hung for several days or small quantities of fermented foods. In general, I don't think humans evolved eating many foods that contain biogenic amines because they evolved eating fresh local in-season food. Domestic pigs on the other hand, have in effect evolved (via selective breading by humans) to eat pig swill, which is basically old human food, which would have contained a lot of biogenic amines, and so I think that pigs are naturally far better at neutralising biogenic amines than humans.</p>
<p>The pigs with the blocked DAO production had severely raised levels of histamine in their blood. Although this isn't in itself surprising, the authors noted that 20% of humans eat or drink things that similarly block DAO production and so they suggested that histamine from food getting into the bloodstream in humans is likely to be a problem.</p>
<p>Both this pig study and the human study discussed previously are very small and so you can't draw very solid conclusions from them. But I couldn't find any other studies on the subject.</p>
<p>My estimate of 60% to 100% of humans being unable to stop biogenic amines in food from getting into their bloodstreams comes from these studies so it's really a very wild guess. The 60% is made up of the 50% of humans that had reactions to the histamine in the human study, plus 20% of the remaining 50% who might be taking DOA inhibiting substances.</p>
<p>The 100% is based on the possibility that no humans can stop all biogenic amines getting into their blood streams and the reason that the 50% in the human study didn't show any reaction is that the histamine molecules all attached to cells whose response couldn't be felt, such as cells in the heart and artery walls and cells in osteoclasts.</p>
<h2 id="the-book-trace-amines-and-neurological-disorders">The book 'Trace Amines and Neurological Disorders'</h2>
<p>There is actually a book that has been published called 'Trace Amines and Neurological Disorders: Potential Mechanisms and Risk Factors' by Tahira Farooqui and Akhlaq A. Farooqui which also indirectly supports my theory.</p>
<p>They weren't looking at the diseases of industrialisation in general, but neurological disorders in particular. I haven't read the book, but there are some extracts of it available on the internet. Here are some of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...in a diverse array of human pathologies ranging from substance abuse, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, schizophrenia, and other neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, the levels of trace amines are unusually high with an imbalance in their functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Biogenic amines have been shown to occur in various foods like fish, meat, cheese, vegetables, and wines.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...Biogenic amines may thus enter the bloodstream postprandially.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So they are basically saying that in people with the various diseases they list, they have unusually high levels of biogenic amines in their body and they suspect that these higher levels come from eating foods that are high in biogenic amines.</p>
<p>The reason that I think that the findings can be applicable beyond just neurological disorders is that biogenic amines can potentially attach to a very wide range of cells in the body, and the exact cells that the molecules attach to will determine the disease. Studies have shown that even in a particular individual, the cells that histamine molecules attach to can vary from one day to another. So I don't think it is unreasonable to assume that different individuals may have different predispositions for which cells biogenic amines will attach to.</p>
<p>For example, if biogenic amine molecules tend to attach themselves to histamine receptors in an artery, it might trigger inflammation. Over a period of regularly eating foods high in biogenic amines, the person might get heart disease. Similarly, if the molecules tend to attach to osteoclast receptors, they might end up with osteoporosis. Similarly, if they tend to attach to cell receptors in blood vessels in the head they might end up getting headaches. And so on.</p>
<h1 id="practice">Practice</h1>
<p>This is still work in progress but will hopefully eventually provide help as to what is allowed and what is prohibited on this diet.</p>
<h2 id="meat-and-fish">Meat and fish</h2>
<p>This is one of the most important parts because biogenic amines grow very quickly in foods high in protein and techniques that supermarkets use to give them a longer shelf life allow biogenic amines to increase yet the food appears to be fresh.</p>
<p>Meat and fish can only come from an actual butcher or fishmonger, or the butcher or fishmonger counter at a supermarket, and where the food hasn't been previously frozen.</p>
<p>The meat and fish available ready-packed on the shelves in supermarkets is forbidden on this diet. The packaging stops aerobic bacteria from multiplying and so the food seems fresh. But anaerobic bacteria continue to multiply and produce biogenic amines.</p>
<p>Tinned and frozen meat and fish is prohibited on this diet. It is well-established by scientific studies that these foods can be high in biogenic amines. Meat and fish bought fresh in accordance with the requirements above can be frozen at home, but must be eaten within 2 weeks, ideally within 1 week.</p>
<p>Liver, while nutritious, is best avoided, because biogenic amines accumulate really fast in these. Traditional hunter-gathers actually cook and eat the liver immediately on killing the animal. It's almost impossible to get it sufficiently fresh in the modern world.</p>
<p>Seafood (e.g. shellfish) also accumulates biogenic amines very quickly. You have to make sure it's fresh that morning, or ideally still alive (e.g. for oysters, mussels, crab and langoustines sometimes).</p>
