## The Pig study

There was also a [study of pigs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3134804) where they gave some pigs a dose of histamine and some of the pigs also were given a substance to block their production of DAO. DAO is what pigs (and humans) naturally produce to neutralise biogenic amines such as histamine in their digestive systems to stop it going into their bloodstreams. 

As noted above, my theory is that humans may only be able to neutralise biogenic amines in foods that they have evolved eating in a form that contains biogenic amines, such as red meat that has been hung for several days or small quantities of fermented foods. In general, I don't think humans evolved eating many foods that contain biogenic amines because they evolved eating fresh local in-season food. Domestic pigs on the other hand, have in effect evolved (via selective breading by humans) to eat pig swill, which is basically old human food, which would have contained a lot of biogenic amines, and so I think that pigs are naturally far better at neutralising biogenic amines than humans.

The pigs with the blocked DAO production had severely raised levels of histamine in their blood. Although this isn't in itself surprising, the authors noted that 20% of humans eat or drink things that similarly block DAO production and so they suggested that histamine from food getting into the bloodstream in humans is likely to be a problem.

Both this pig study and the human study discussed previously are very small and so you can't draw very solid conclusions from them. But I couldn't find any other studies on the subject. 

My estimate of 60% to 100% of humans being unable to stop biogenic amines in food from getting into their bloodstreams comes from these studies so it's really a very wild guess. The 60% is made up of the 50% of humans that had reactions to the histamine in the human study, plus 20% of the remaining 50% who might be taking DOA inhibiting substances. 

The 100% is based on the possibility that no humans can stop all biogenic amines getting into their blood streams and the reason that the 50% in the human study didn't show any reaction is that the histamine molecules all attached to cells whose response couldn't be felt, such as cells in the heart and artery walls and cells in osteoclasts.
