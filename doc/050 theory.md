# Theory


This section sets out the theories behind the main diet rules and the fresh food rules.

You don't need to read any of this if you aren't interested. You can skip to the practical details further down.

In the past 200 or so years, and especially in the past 40 years, there has been a huge increase in certain diseases. They broadly fit into the following categories:

1. Some cancers
1. Cardiovascular diseases (e.g. heart disease and stroke)
1. Metabolic syndrome diseases (e.g. weight gain, obesity, diabetes)
1. Autoimmune diseases
1. Cognitive diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's Disease)
1. Neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g. eating disorders, schizophrenia, depression)

These diseases are sometimes collectively called the 'diseases of industrialization'. Many of them could equally well be called the diseases of inflammation as chronic inflammation is common to many of them. 

Researchers have been trying to work out why this has happened, and they are still not sure. All that is known for sure is that we went from eating fresh, local, in-season produce, prepared in our own kitchens, to eating food with long shelf lives that have been produced and prepared elsewhere. Most researchers, as far as I can tell, agree that some aspects of this have caused the problems. But no one really knows exactly what the aspects are, advice on what to do has been astoundingly unsuccessful and there isn't really a very good explanation for exactly what is causing the chronic inflammation.

My theory is that the chronic inflammation, as well as various other problems, are caused by dietary biogenic amines passing from the digestive system into the bloodstream. This is contrary to mainstream theory which says that dietary biogenic amines are fully neutralised in the digestive system.
