## Ingredients list no greater than 1

In general, you should buy raw individual ingredients and prepare your meals yourself in your own kitchen. For example, if you buy some onions, the packaging will just say 'onions' - an ingredients list of 1. This is what you should be aiming for. You can use as many ingredients as you want in your cooking at home, it's the point at which you buy the ingredients that the restriction applies to.

This rule may seem a bit extreme, but there are some exceptions to it.

If salt is the only other ingredient then it's ok, although it's still better to buy a version without salt and then add your own if you can. That way you can use better quality salt, such as traditionally-made sea salt.

If the food has been made freshly in a restaurant from fresh ingredients that comply with this diet, but nevertheless has an ingredients list for some reason, then it's ok.

Freshly made sandwiches, wraps and salads from cafés and shops are sometimes ok too. I wouldn't recommend eating these foods often though because sometimes the meat and fish in them can be high in biogenic amines. It's difficult to tell. And bread is a bit of a borderline food anyway. But once a week might not be harmful. 

The shelf life for the above allowed foods from restaurants, cafés and shops should be basically that day only, or maybe one extra day, but you should eat them on the first day.

The danger with other pre-prepared foods made offsite and with longer shelf lives is that they are very likely to be high in biogenic amines. However, pre-cooked foods with a use-by date that is 6 or more days away is generally ok.

Ready meals are forbidden on this diet. Although I suspect there's a lot of variation between supermarkets (Waitrose ready meals may be better, I don't know), ready meals can be very high in biogenic amines. Sometimes the food in them is weeks or even months old. A lot of the ingredients can come from thousands of miles away and can have been stored in frozen form in central warehouses for very long periods. They use these ingredients because it keeps the costs down. By the time the food goes into the ready meal it sometimes has little or no flavour, colour or texture, so all sorts of additives are used to artificially add them back in. But the biogenic amines remain.

If you are absolutely desperate and have no choice but to eat a ready meal, as a one-off occasion, try to find one that doesn't have any E numbers or the words 'extract' (e.g. yeast extract) or 'starch' or anything that you aren't sure what it is on the ingredients list at all. If you have any doubt about the horrors of additives, read Swallow This by Joanna Blythman. She talks of how, following the consumer reaction against E numbers, food producers have tried to 'clean-label' their products, that is, replace E numbers on the ingredients list with something which doesn't sound so bad but could actually be worse. When they say 'yeast extract' they aren't talking about Marmite. I suspect that you can breed yeasts to contain more or less anything you want and extract it from them. And vegetables contain lots of different chemicals that can be extracted. These chemicals are fine altogether in a vegetable in its natural form, but not individually when extracted and purified. E number chemicals were often extracted from vegetables. So 'vegetable extract' is no better. Any 'extract' is unacceptable. At least with E numbers, scientists knew exactly what the chemical was and could investigate its effects, but with these 'extracts' it's harder to know what chemical they are.

So a further implication of this rule is that you shouldn't be eating foods containing any artificial ingredients such as E numbers or vegetable extracts.
