# Introduction

This is a diet based on a combination of:   

1. Several fairly widely-accepted, although not exactly mainstream, concepts about the recent rise of obesity and other chronic illnesses.
1. An entirely unproven theory of my own about biogenic amines that I've never heard anyone else suggest. It is contrary to mainstream theory.

It mainly involves eating fresh food, but what constitutes fresh is quite strict - some foods considered fresh by many people are forbidden.

It does not involve going hungry - it is not a calorie-controlled diet; you can eat as much as you like. But it does require self-discipline, at least initially, because for most people it probably involves a complete change of eating habits, more difficultly shopping, more time spent cooking and the foregoing of many compelling foods.

It also involves various other behaviours which I consider healthy.

I personally follow this diet and it seems to work for me. According to my genetic analysis on the website [23andMe.com][23andMe], I am predisposed to weigh 190 pounds (86kg, 13 stone 8) whereas I actually weigh 150 pounds (68kg, 10 stone 10). According to an MRI scan I have zero detectable calcified plaque in my heart and arteries, and my blood test levels for inflammation are always low. 

Whether it works for anyone else or not - I don't know. But I wanted to set out my diet in case anyone else wants to try it or might find it interesting. But if anyone does, please note [The Mother Of All Disclaimers][disclaimer]. 

Also, it is a low histamine/low biogenic amine diet, so anyone who, like me, has histamine intolerance, may find it interesting.
