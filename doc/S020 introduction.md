# Introduction

Over the past 200 years, and particularly over the past 40, there has been a dramatic increase in a wide range of chronic diseases that were rare before, including heart disease, obesity, cancer, auto-immune diseases and depression. These are sometimes called the diseases of industrialization but they could equally well be called the diseases of chronic inflammation as this tends to accompany them. Scientists do not know what has caused this increase. We do know that in that time we have gone from eating fresh, in-season, local produce prepared in our own kitchens to eating mostly commercially-prepared food with longer shelf lives. My theory is that the cause of the increase has 2 parts. First, our diets have damaged the integrity of our gut lining so that molecules in our diets are able to pass into the blood stream that previously could not. Second, the molecules that are causing the most harm are amines such as histamine. Previously our diets would have contained almost none of these, and now, due to modern techniques to extend the shelf lives of food, they contain very high levels. This diet aims to address these 2 parts.

It mainly involves eating fresh food, but what constitutes fresh is quite strict - some foods considered fresh by many people are forbidden.

It does not involve going hungry - it is not a calorie-controlled diet; you can eat as much as you like. But it does require self-discipline, at least initially, because for most people it probably involves a complete change of eating habits, more difficultly shopping, more time spent cooking and the foregoing of many compelling foods.

It also involves various other behaviours which I consider healthy.

I personally follow this diet and it seems to work for me. According to my genetic analysis on the website [23andMe.com][23andMe], I am predisposed to weigh 190 pounds (86kg, 13 stone 8) whereas I actually weigh 140 pounds (63kg, 10 stone). According to an MRI scan I have zero detectable calcified plaque in my heart and arteries, and my blood test levels for inflammation are always low. 

Whether it works for anyone else or not - I don't know. But I wanted to set out my diet in case anyone else wants to try it or might find it interesting. You might consider trying [The 3-day Test][three_day]. But please note [the disclaimer][disclaimer]. 

Also, it is a low histamine/low biogenic amine diet, so anyone who, like me, has histamine intolerance, may find it interesting.
