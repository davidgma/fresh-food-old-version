## Always Ok

Some foods tend to be low enough in biogenic amines that, although if you can get them local, in season and organic this is best, they can nevertheless be eaten year-round even if they come from a bit further afield. They have to be fresh of course in the sense of not being tinned etc. I eat these very regularly throughout the year and have no problems with them:

Celery  
Cucumber  
Carrots  
Sweet peppers  
Cabbage including red cabbage  
Lettuce  

Packaged fresh salad leaves, such as rocket from Italy packaged in a protective atmosphere and sold in Britain, are also allowed as they still have fairly short shelf lives and don't contain much protein so there's little scope for developing a lot of biogenic amines.

Root vegetables including potatoes, swede, celeriac and turnips, are also allowed year-round. They are often stored for significant periods as far as I understand it, but this is an agricultural technique that has been done for thousands of years and so I think that we have adapted to it and so our bodies are able to neutralise the biogenic amines.

Winter squashes such as pumpkins and butternut squashes that are in season are also allowed even if they aren't organic and are from a bit further away (e.g. from continental Europe if you are British) because, like root vegetables, I think we are adapted to them being stored for slightly longer periods.
