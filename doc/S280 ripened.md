## Artificially ripened foods

You may not be aware that a great number of fruits and vegetables in the 'fresh' food sections of supermarkets are artificially ripened. Sometimes even the staff in supermarkets haven't heard of it. So let me explain what it is.

In the UK, as an example, normal tomatoes are in season fairly briefly in the summer. But tomatoes are available in supermarkets all year round. The main way that this is achieved is by growing enough tomatoes to meet supply for the whole year, and harvesting enough of them to supply the out-of-season period when they are still green and under-ripe. These under-ripe tomatoes are then kept at low temperatures for months until they are needed. Then they are warmed up and put in an ethylene environment, which causes them to ripen. They then look and taste like an in-season tomato. But during those months of storage, biogenic amines accumulate in them. This is probably the reason that a lot of people find that tomatoes give them a headache.

Mainstream advice to people with histamine intolerance is to avoid tomatoes. But in my opinion this isn't very good advice. Firstly because it's possible to buy tomatoes that are not artificially ripened; these are absolutely fine. And secondly because lots of fruits and vegetables are artificially ripened and so it's far better to learn how to avoid artificially ripened food.

Unfortunately there's no labelling on foods to tell you whether they are artificially ripened or not and the supermarket staff are very unlikely to know. But there are some basic rules you can follow. 

### Local and in-season

The first rule is that if the food is local and in-season, it is very unlikely to be artificially ripened and so is allowed on this diet. When I say local, I mean from the same country that your are in, or maybe at least the same landmass and within a day or two's transport. So for British people, for example, that would mean grown in Britain. There's a website for British people called [eattheseasons](http://www.eattheseasons.co.uk/) which tells you what is in season. 

The eattheseasons website has a minor drawback when it comes to estimating whether a locally-grown food is likely to be free of any artificial ripening because it doesn't list all foods which are safe to eat all year round, either because they can be grown in greenhouses all year round or because their storage doesn't seem to give rise to problems with biogenic amines (possibly because we have evolved eating the foods this way). 

For the UK, the following vegetables can be eaten all year round (so long as they are from UK sources):
broccoli, cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, kale, celery, fennel, french beans, garlic, lettuce, mangetout, mushrooms, onion, potato, rocket/arugula, samphire, shallots, spinach, spring greens/collards.

In fact, there is a variety of tomato available in the UK that can be eaten all year round. Look for on-the-vine organic tomatoes from the Isle of Wight. 

In the UK, another good option is to buy your fruit and vegetables from a reputable Farmer's Market. In these, it is generally a requirement that all the fruit and vegetables are local and in-season. 

An exception to this rule is that berries (blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries) tend to always be alright even if they are from far away as I think they are flown in by air. So they aren't very good for the environment but they don't contain much histamine and are healthy.

Also, as it can be hard sometimes finding foods from the same country as your are, for practical reasons it's not too bad to buy from a bit further afield, for example I sometimes buy vegetables from Spain and don't have any problems with them.

### Organic

The Soil Association has [rules on using ethylene](https://www.soilassociation.org/media/15883/food-and-drink-standards.pdf):

> You may use ethylene only: 
> 1. to ripen bananas, kiwis and kakis  
> 2. to ripen citrus fruit as part of a strategy to prevent fruit fly damage  

Thanks to these rules, all organic fruit and vegetables are allowed on this diet, apart from bananas, kiwi fruit, kakis (whatever they are) and citrus fruit. Bananas, kiwi fruit, kakis and citrus fruit are therefore prohibited on this diet unless you are in a country where they are grown locally and are in season.

Also, the organic fruit and vegetables should be in season in the country from which they came.

An exception is aubergine/eggplant which you have to be very careful of. For some reason, biogenic amines form particularly rapidly in these and so even organic aubergines are forbidden if they aren't local. I consistently react to organic aubergines from continental Europe. I really like aubergines but the only time I can eat them is when they are in season in the UK, and even then I try to buy organic.
