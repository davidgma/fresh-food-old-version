## The book 'Trace Amines and Neurological Disorders'

There is actually a book that has been published called 'Trace Amines and Neurological Disorders: Potential Mechanisms and Risk Factors' by Tahira Farooqui and Akhlaq A. Farooqui which also indirectly supports my theory.

They weren't looking at the diseases of industrialisation in general, but neurological disorders in particular. I haven't read the book, but there are some extracts of it available on the internet. Here are some of them:

> ...in a diverse array of human pathologies ranging from substance abuse, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, schizophrenia, and other neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, the levels of trace amines are unusually high with an imbalance in their functions.

> Biogenic amines have been shown to occur in various foods like fish, meat, cheese, vegetables, and wines.

> ...Biogenic amines may thus enter the bloodstream postprandially.

So they are basically saying that in people with the various diseases they list, they have unusually high levels of biogenic amines in their body and they suspect that these higher levels come from eating foods that are high in biogenic amines.

The reason that I think that the findings can be applicable beyond just neurological disorders is that biogenic amines can potentially attach to a very wide range of cells in the body, and the exact cells that the molecules attach to will determine the disease. Studies have shown that even in a particular individual, the cells that histamine molecules attach to can vary from one day to another. So I don't think it is unreasonable to assume that different individuals may have different predispositions for which cells biogenic amines will attach to. 

For example, if biogenic amine molecules tend to attach themselves to histamine receptors in an artery, it might trigger inflammation. Over a period of regularly eating foods high in biogenic amines, the person might get heart disease. Similarly, if the molecules tend to attach to osteoclast receptors, they might end up with osteoporosis. Similarly, if they tend to attach to cell receptors in blood vessels in the head they might end up getting headaches. If they tend to attach to cell receptors that regulate the circadian rhythm then they might end up with sleep disorders. And so on. They might also get a combination of diseases where more than one type of cell receptor is attached to.
