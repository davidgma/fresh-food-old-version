## Biogenic Amines - My Theory

So my theory, and it is only a theory, is that dietary biogenic amines pass from the digestive system into the bloodstream in between 60% and 100% of people, and not [1%](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/85/5/1185/4633007) as is the mainstream view. 

This might seem like a minor detail of no real significance, but in fact it is hugely significant. If this theory is true, everything changes. The vast majority of foods available in a typical supermarket, including foods currently considered healthy, would instead be considered unhealthy and would probably end up being banned by governments. The entire processed food industry would be under threat. There would be an additional and major plausible explanation for the surge in chronic disease over the last 40 years or so and an additional and powerful course of action available to those who care about their health.

Given the significance of this point, I think that it is surprising that, as far as I can tell, it has rarely been studied. I could only find 2 very small studies about it on Pubmed (a repository of scientific studies). These, taken together, suggest that biogenic amines do pass into the bloodstream in between 60% and 100% of people.

Let me explain.
