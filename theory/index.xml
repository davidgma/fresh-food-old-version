      <title>Biogenic Amines - My Theory</title>

      <description>Introduction My theory, and it is only a theory, is that dietary biogenic amines pass from the gut into the bloodstream in between 60% and 100% of people, and not between 2% and 5% as is the mainstream view.
This might seem like a minor detail of no real significance, but in fact it is hugely significant. If this theory is true, everything changes. The vast majority of foods available in a typical supermarket, including foods currently considered healthy, would instead be considered unhealthy and would probably end up being banned by governments.</description>
