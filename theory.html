<p>This section sets out the theories behind the main diet rules and the fresh food rules.</p>
<p>You don't need to read any of this if you aren't interested. You can skip to the practical details section.</p>
<p>In the past 200 or so years, and especially in the past 40 years, there has been a huge increase in certain diseases. They broadly fit into the following categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some cancers</li>
<li>Cardiovascular diseases (e.g. heart disease and stroke)</li>
<li>Metabolic syndrome diseases (e.g. weight gain, obesity, diabetes)</li>
<li>Autoimmune diseases</li>
<li>Cognitive diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's Disease)</li>
<li>Neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g. eating disorders, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety)</li>
</ol>
<p>These diseases are sometimes collectively called the 'diseases of industrialization'. Many of them could equally well be called the diseases of inflammation as chronic inflammation is common to many of them.</p>
<p>Researchers have been trying to work out why this has happened, and they are still not sure. All that is known for sure is that we went from eating fresh, local, in-season produce, prepared in our own kitchens, to eating food with long shelf lives that is produced and prepared elsewhere. Most researchers, as far as I can tell, agree that some aspects of this have caused the problems. But no one really knows exactly what the aspects are, advice on what to do has been astoundingly unsuccessful and there isn't really a very good explanation for exactly what is causing the chronic inflammation.</p>
<p>My theory is that the chronic inflammation, as well as various other problems, are caused by dietary biogenic amines passing from the digestive system into the bloodstream. This is contrary to mainstream theory which says that dietary biogenic amines are fully neutralised in the digestive system.</p>
<h2 id="biogenic-amines---my-theory">Biogenic Amines - My Theory</h2>
<p>So my theory, and it is only a theory, is that dietary biogenic amines pass from the digestive system into the bloodstream in between 60% and 100% of people, and not <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/85/5/1185/4633007">1%</a> as is the mainstream view.</p>
<p>This might seem like a minor detail of no real significance, but in fact it is hugely significant. If this theory is true, everything changes. The vast majority of foods available in a typical supermarket, including foods currently considered healthy, would instead be considered unhealthy and would probably end up being banned by governments. The entire processed food industry would be under threat. There would be an additional and major plausible explanation for the surge in chronic disease over the last 40 years or so and an additional and powerful course of action available to those who care about their health.</p>
<p>Given the significance of this point, I think that it is surprising that, as far as I can tell, it has rarely been studied. I could only find 2 very small studies about it on Pubmed (a repository of scientific studies). These, taken together, suggest that biogenic amines do pass into the bloodstream in between 60% and 100% of people.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<h2 id="histamine-intolerance">Histamine Intolerance</h2>
<p>Let me start with an overview of histamine intolerance - a condition I personally suffer from - because it sets out what is accepted by the mainstream scientists and doctors.</p>
<p>Histamine intolerance is an officially-recognised condition that is based on the following 3 accepted facts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Many modern foods, unlike those eaten by our ancestors, contain relatively large quantities of histamine and other so-called 'biogenic amines' - molecules that are used internally as a signalling chemical for various purposes by many species including humans. The majority of methods that allow foods to have a longer shelf life and be available out of season cause biogenic amines to be created in the foods. The biogenic amines are created as a by-product of microbial activity and increase over time; when the food is first harvested/killed it contains negligible quantities of biogenic amines.</li>
<li>If the histamine and other biogenic amines were to pass from the foods in our digestive systems into the blood stream, it would be expected to cause health issues because various parts of the body would respond to their signalling effects but the signalling would be unwanted because it had come from foods and not from the body's own signalling mechanisms. Biogenic amines are known to be involved in stimulating inflammation, pulling calcium out of bones, regulating the sleep-wake cycle, mediating neuronal signalling and regulating digestion.</li>
<li>The digestive system neutralizes the biogenic amines with a chemical called DAO so that they do not pass into the blood stream and do not cause these signalling problems. But in 1% of people, this neutralization process is inadequate and biogenic amines do pass into the bloodstream and do cause signalling problems and corresponding health problems. This 1% of people are said to have histamine intolerance.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is this final part that is wrong according to my theory. It is instead between 60% and 100% of people that cannot neutralize all of the biogenic amines in food and this leads to a large variety of potential health problems including chronic inflammation, calcium metabolism disorders, digestive disorders and sleep disorders. Chronic inflammation then contributes strongly to one or more of: weight gain, heart disease, cancer, auto-immune diseases and cognitive diseases.</p>
<p>I don't know why exactly biogenic amines don't get fully neutralized in the digestive system. I don't dispute that the body has a mechanism, via DAO, to neutralize them. I think it is likely that it is due to one or more of the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>We have damaged our guts such that the gut lining lets through molecules that it shouldn't, including histamine and other amines. This seems by far the most likely reason to me.</li>
<li>The sheer volume of biogenic amines we consume nowadays is too much for the body's neutralization system to cope with and it gets overwhelmed.</li>
<li>The neutralization of biogenic amines with DAO only happens where the food is one which we have been eating as a species for a long time in a form that contains biogenic amines so that the body recognises the food and knows to neutralize the biogenic amines. Modern methods of food production have resulted in a large number of foods containing biogenic amines that would never have contained them before, particularly during our evolution as a species, and so our bodies do not expect them to have biogenic amines and do not neutralize them.</li>
<li>We have damaged our body's mechanism for neutralising biogenic amines, for example by taking certain medications that suppress the production of DAO or by damaging our gut microbiome.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-human-study">The Human study</h2>
<p>Given the enormous repercussions should it be the case that biogenic amines in food do pass into the bloodstream of most people, it is surprisingly hard to find any evidence one way or the other. It doesn't seem to have been studied much.</p>
<p>I suspect this is because, as only about 1% of people show symptoms of histamine intolerance, it is simply assumed that everyone else is able to fully neutralize biogenic amines. But as biogenic amines attach to cells in the body (this is how they carry out their signalling function) it is possible that in most people the biogenic amines get attached to cells in the heart, arteries and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2671373/">osteoclasts</a> or other receptors, such that the person doesn't feel anything but nevertheless in time develops diseases. It is well-established that chronic inflammation is associated with a wide range of diseases but people developing these diseases do not feel the inflammation. For example, the accumulation of plaque in people's arteries is associated with chronic inflammation yet people do not feel at all unwell until, after decades of plaque accumulation, they have a heart attack. They do not feel the inflammation. That's why people have blood tests to test for inflammation - if they could feel it they wouldn't need the test. So biogenic amines could plausibly be passing into the blood stream of most people without them feeling unwell, depending on which cells the biogenic amines mainly attached to.</p>
<p>If this were the case then histamine intolerance would probably be better characterised as a predisposition in some people for the biogenic amines to attach to receptors that produce noticeable short-term problems rather than problems that are unnoticeable in the short and medium term.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15603203">One study</a> did test whether histamine, at a normal level found in food, passed into normal people's bloodstreams. It only looked at 10 people unfortunately (plus 10 controls) so is too small a study to draw any concrete conclusions from, but it found that in 5 of the 10 people the histamine did appear to have passed into their bloodstreams as they had noticeable reactions to it whereas none of the controls had any reaction. So this 50% of the sample does massively contradict the mainstream view that only 1% of people can't fully neutralize dietary biogenic amines.</p>
<p>An interesting thing to note from this study is that none of the blood tests taken from the subjects (presumably taken from the arm) showed any raised histamine level, even in the subjects that had a noticeable histamine reaction. This suggests that all the molecules of histamine that did get into the bloodstream had attached to a cell receptor before the blood got to the arm. This might offer another explanation of why the mainstream view is that only 1% of people can't fully neutralize the dietary biogenic amines - any studies conducted by giving subjects a dose of histamine and then looking for changes in blood levels of histamine would find no raised histamine level and then conclude that there was no histamine passing into the bloodstream.</p>
<h2 id="the-pig-study">The Pig study</h2>
<p>There was also a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3134804">study of pigs</a> where they gave some pigs a dose of histamine and some of the pigs also were given a substance to block their production of DAO. DAO is what pigs (and humans) naturally produce to neutralise biogenic amines such as histamine in their digestive systems to stop it going into their bloodstreams.</p>
<p>As noted above, my theory is that humans may only be able to neutralise biogenic amines in foods that they have evolved eating in a form that contains biogenic amines, such as red meat that has been hung for several days or small quantities of fermented foods. In general, I don't think humans evolved eating many foods that contain biogenic amines because they evolved eating fresh local in-season food. Domestic pigs on the other hand, have in effect evolved (via selective breading by humans) to eat pig swill, which is basically old human food, which would have contained a lot of biogenic amines, and so I think that pigs are naturally far better at neutralising biogenic amines than humans.</p>
<p>The pigs with the blocked DAO production had severely raised levels of histamine in their blood. Although this isn't in itself surprising, the authors noted that 20% of humans eat or drink things that similarly block DAO production and so they suggested that histamine from food getting into the bloodstream in humans is likely to be a problem.</p>
<p>Both this pig study and the human study discussed previously are very small and so you can't draw very solid conclusions from them. But I couldn't find any other studies on the subject.</p>
<p>My estimate of 60% to 100% of humans being unable to stop biogenic amines in food from getting into their bloodstreams comes from these studies so it's really a very wild guess. The 60% is made up of the 50% of humans that had reactions to the histamine in the human study, plus 20% of the remaining 50% who might be taking DOA inhibiting substances.</p>
<p>The 100% is based on the possibility that no humans can stop all biogenic amines getting into their blood streams and the reason that the 50% in the human study didn't show any reaction is that the histamine molecules all attached to cells whose response couldn't be felt, such as cells in the heart and artery walls and cells in osteoclasts.</p>
<h2 id="the-book-trace-amines-and-neurological-disorders">The book 'Trace Amines and Neurological Disorders'</h2>
<p>There is actually a book that has been published called 'Trace Amines and Neurological Disorders: Potential Mechanisms and Risk Factors' by Tahira Farooqui and Akhlaq A. Farooqui which also indirectly supports my theory.</p>
<p>They weren't looking at the diseases of industrialisation in general, but neurological disorders in particular. I haven't read the book, but there are some extracts of it available on the internet. Here are some of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...in a diverse array of human pathologies ranging from substance abuse, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, schizophrenia, and other neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, the levels of trace amines are unusually high with an imbalance in their functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Biogenic amines have been shown to occur in various foods like fish, meat, cheese, vegetables, and wines.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...Biogenic amines may thus enter the bloodstream postprandially.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So they are basically saying that in people with the various diseases they list, they have unusually high levels of biogenic amines in their body and they suspect that these higher levels come from eating foods that are high in biogenic amines.</p>
<p>The reason that I think that the findings can be applicable beyond just neurological disorders is that biogenic amines can potentially attach to a very wide range of cells in the body, and the exact cells that the molecules attach to will determine the disease. Studies have shown that even in a particular individual, the cells that histamine molecules attach to can vary from one day to another. So I don't think it is unreasonable to assume that different individuals may have different predispositions for which cells biogenic amines will attach to.</p>
<p>For example, if biogenic amine molecules tend to attach themselves to histamine receptors in an artery, it might trigger inflammation. Over a period of regularly eating foods high in biogenic amines, the person might get heart disease. Similarly, if the molecules tend to attach to osteoclast receptors, they might end up with osteoporosis. Similarly, if they tend to attach to cell receptors in blood vessels in the head they might end up getting headaches. If they tend to attach to cell receptors that regulate the circadian rhythm then they might end up with sleep disorders. And so on. They might also get a combination of diseases where more than one type of cell receptor is attached to.</p>
<h2 id="broken-mechanisms">Broken Mechanisms</h2>
<p>In my opinion, most or all of the 'diseases of industrialisation' can be viewed as failures of mechanisms in our bodies rather than mainly the result of an external cause. This is more a way of looking at things rather than a new theory in itself.</p>
<p>The mainstream approach seems to be to treat all diseases as the result of an external cause, perhaps because, before the diseases of industrialisation, this was probably almost always the case. For example, if a person is bitten by a mosquito that passes on the parasite that causes malaria, then that parasite is the external cause of the malaria. Whether the person survives will depend on whether their immune systems can defeat the parasite.</p>
<p>However, I don't think that the diseases of industrialisation fit well into this paradigm. Our species, homo sapiens, has been around for about 200,000 to 300,000 years and it's probably only been in the last few hundred that these diseases have existed in anything other than negligible amounts and only in the last 40 or so years that they have really mushroomed.</p>
<p>The external environment has changed, but it doesn't seem to me to have changed enough to explain the rise of these diseases. The explanation that seems better to me is that mechanisms in our bodies that used to stop these diseases from ever happening have stopped working. We have broken our natural mechanisms.</p>
<p>For example, I believe that we have a natural mechanism to stop us from becoming fat. The argument that some put forward that we have evolved to put on as much weight as possible when there's enough food so as to survive in a famine does not, in my opinion, stand up at all to scrutiny. The argument is called 'the thrifty gene hypothesis' and has been very widely discredited. Instead, many experts say that we evolved in an environment with few humans and plenty of resources that our ancestors were very adept at using. Scientists studying hunter gathers reckon that it probably only took them 2 or 3 days of work a week to get all the food they needed and famines would have been rare. The Economist magazine says that famines only happen when both a natural disaster and bad government occur together. I doubt that any hunter gatherer chiefs, however bad, would have been able to contribute to a famine - they just wouldn't have had enough influence over the environment. The idea that humans have only had enough food to eat in the last 40 years, and that's why many have become so fat, doesn't even tie up with living memory. I remember 40 years ago, when almost no-one was that fat, and there was a huge middle class in Britain that had enough food to eat and didn't get fat.</p>
<p>Whereas not being fat would have been advantageous to our ancestors as it would have helped with hunting, gathering, running from wild animals and fending off rival humans. So I think it likely that we evolved to have a natural mechanism to stop us getting fat. Our appetite plays a role in this mechanism as does how energetic we feel.</p>
<p>So it seems more likely to me that where people have not stayed slim, it's because they have broken this mechanism. The answer is not to try to starve themselves when they feel ravenous and force themselves to exercise when they feel completely lethargic, because it takes more will power than people have over the long term. The answer is to fix the mechanism so that the body will naturally become slimmer by being less hungry and feeling more energetic. The person will be working with their body rather than against it.</p>
<p>It is my theory that a significant contributing factor to breaking this mechanism is chronic inflammation caused by dietary biogenic amines passing into the blood stream. I have noticed that when I have a cold I always feel hungrier and more lethargic than normal and I invariably put on weight. But then I lose that weight again very easily on recovering from the cold. It makes sense to me that when the body is under attack from a parasite it should go into a state of inflammation and take on more calories to give its immune system the best chance of defeating the parasite. So it seems likely to me that when the body is in a state of inflammation, it will naturally want to take on more calories. The problem with today's diet of foods containing biogenic amines, according to my theory, is that people have a state of permanent inflammation and so they permanently put on weight. By changing to a diet low in biogenic amines they might be able to end their chronic inflammation and their bodies might naturally lose weight as they will feel less hungry and more energetic for a time until their weight has reduced again. For a person of a healthy weight, eating extra calories will not lead to weight gain but rather to not feeling hungry for longer or feeling more energetic.</p>
<p>Another example is that of heart disease. The mainstream efforts to address this problem seem to involve looking for external causes. The idea seems to be that something external is causing problematic plaque deposits to form in the heart and arteries. Saturated fat has been suggested as a factor. However, many doctors and scientists who have studied this put up very compelling arguments as to why saturated fat is not a cause of heart disease. But what no one seems to be considering is the notion that plaques forming in the heart and arteries is completely normal and has always happened, but throughout most of human existence the body simply removed them again. What has changed might instead be that we have broken the mechanism that removes the plaques so that they keep accumulating and end up causing heart disease and strokes.</p>
<p>Here's my layman's view of inflammation and removal of debris within the body. Imagine you are bitten by a mosquito. It doesn't carry the parasite that causes malaria so you're not in any serious danger. Soon after the bite, the site of the bite swells up and becomes itchy. This is a reaction of the body to try to fight a possible infection that might arise because of the bite. The inflammation of the area helps to stop the spread of any parasites that might have been introduced. It's intentionally created by the body and the body achieves this by the release of histamine, a biogenic amine, at the local site. It may be annoying, but it's a good thing. Over the next few days, the body's immune system will go to work to make the area safe, killing any parasites it can. Once the site is safe, the swelling comes down and then, over the next few days, the site is restored to normal and looks exactly the same as before the bite happened. It seems likely to me that this final step would involve removing any debris from the site such as the immune cells that were active there. It wouldn't make sense to reduce the inflammation until the site is safe and it wouldn't make sense to remove the debris until the site is safe, so it seems plausible to me that the body would naturally not remove debris from an internal site until any inflammation has subsided.</p>
<p>My theory is that dietary biogenic amines pass into the blood stream and can attach to receptor cells in the heart and arteries and cause inflammation. Because this happens after most meals, the inflammation is chronic - it's there almost all the time for decades. So perhaps, because of the chronic inflammation, the body's natural mechanism for clearing any plaques from the heart and arteries holds off doing so, waiting for the inflammation to subside. But it never does.</p>
<h2 id="occams-razor">Occam's Razor</h2>
<p>Occam's Razor is a philosophical principal that says that the explanation that requires the fewest assumptions is usually correct.</p>
<p>Most, if not all, of the so-called diseases of industrialisation can be explained by just one assumption: that the body does not fully stop dietary biogenic amines from passing into the blood stream.</p>
<p>Biogenic amines have such an extensive signalling role within the body, including causing inflammation and regulating calcium, the circadian rhythm, digestion and cognition, that an enormous range of modern diseases could be explained by this one assumption.</p>
<p>So although Occam's Razor isn't a proof that my theory is right, it does suggest that it may well be.</p>
<h2 id="hunger-and-fatigue">Hunger and fatigue</h2>
<p>In my experience, there are broadly 2 types of hunger. There is normal hunger which comes on if it's been a while since you last ate and gets worse gradually until you eat again. Then there is an extreme type of hunger that I only get when I'm ill - for example when I have a cold. This hunger is overwhelming and compelling. Regardless of how much self control you have, there is no resisting it. Your body needs more energy to fight the infection and doesn't give you a choice. You absolutely have to eat. You can think of nothing else but your hunger.</p>
<p>When I have a cold I invariably eat more and gain a few pounds, but then once I'm over the cold I feel far less hungry and easily return to my previous weight.</p>
<p>I also feel totally exhausted when I have a cold as my body is telling me that it needs all its energy to fight the infection. The fatigue, like the hunger, is totally overwhelming and compels me to rest.</p>
<p>I don't know what it's like being someone else, but my suspicion is that for overweight people, the type of hunger they get is the second type, the overwhelming and compelling type. According to my theory, what happens is that the biogenic amines in the food they eat get into their blood stream and cause inflammation. The inflammation then causes their bodies to incorrectly assume that they have an infection to fight and so the second type of hunger is triggered, as well as the fatigue. They have no choice but to eat and rest, regardless of how much self control they have. But because they eat food that is high in biogenic amines every day, the inflammation never subsides and the extreme hunger and fatigue never go. They can see that they are eating a lot and exercising little and can also see that they are eating a lot more and exercising much less than thin people, and they assume that they have far less self control than thin people and blame themselves. Other people, both overweight and thin, think the same way and blame overweight people for lacking self control and consider their weight problem to be their own fault due to their gluttony and sloth.</p>
<p>But I don't think that overweight people do lack self control, but rather, the intensity of the hunger and fatigue they feel is so great that no one feeling the same would be able to resist eating and resting. According to my theory, following The Fresh Food Diet is the best way to solve the problem because it reduces the inflammation which then reduces the intensity of hunger to normal, resistible levels and returns energy levels to normal.</p>

<h2 id="a-trip-down-memory-lane">A Trip Down Memory Lane</h2>
<p>Many researchers study the diets and lifestyles of populations of people who lived in traditional ways that hadn't changed much for thousands, or in some cases tens of thousands, of years, and who had spectacularly good health compared to most of us nowadays. Hunter gathers are one example but there have been others such as Scottish crofters and Swiss alpine farmers. I think the information gathered from these studies is very useful in better understanding nutrition and the rise of modern diseases. One very clear similarity between all the various traditional populations is that they almost exclusively ate very fresh, local, in-season produce that they cooked themselves.</p>
<p>This approach to nutrition has many critics who argue that as most of these populations have long-since ceased to exist, we're not really sure exactly how they lived and even if we did know, the foods they ate are no longer available.</p>
<p>But we don't have to go back so far. The really dramatic rise in the chronic diseases that afflict us today has happened in the last 40 or so years. I was born into a fairly affluent middle class family in the south east of England in 1966. I remember a time when almost nobody of any age was fat yet everyone ate 3 times a day until they were full. We all ate as much as we liked and rarely got fat.</p>
<p>So I'm going to set out my memory of what we ate in those days. I was pretty young so I apologise if I've misremembered some things.</p>
<p>One thing that people often don't notice is how much richer, in absolute terms, people have become over time. Poverty is generally measured in relative terms, for example a person is considered poor if their income is more than 40% below average. With this measure, poverty is in effect a result of inequality rather than necessarily a lack of purchasing power. But in absolute terms, people have become far richer. I think I saw a study that found that the purchasing power of a family in the top 20% of income when I was young would now be approximately in the bottom 20%. Most people nowadays can afford so much stuff that almost no one could afford when I was young. For example, despite being from a fairly affluent family, I had very few clothes as a child and what I had came from jumble sales. If I go on I'll sound like the Monty Python sketch where they talk about eating cold gravel for breakfast. Life was actually pretty good (it's even better now), we just couldn't afford to buy that much stuff; almost no one could.</p>
<p>People rarely ate at restaurants or from takeaways. They couldn't afford to. You might get some fish and chips once every couple of weeks. There weren't many restaurants in those days - there just wasn't the call for them. A typical medium size town would have a 'Bernie Inn' where people might go for steak and chips as a treat to celebrate their birthday and maybe an Italian restaurant. There would be a few fish and chip shops and maybe a couple of Chinese takeaways. Nowadays the same town will have at least 20 restaurants and multiple fast food outlets.</p>
<p>Supermarkets were only just arriving. We had a lesson in primary school about what they are and the teacher pronounced 'supermarket' in an odd way. More typically, a family food shop would involve a visit to a greengrocer and a visit to a butcher. The food available was mostly local as the cost of importing exotic fruits and vegetables from overseas would have made them unaffordable.</p>
<p>The fruits and vegetables were also mostly in-season as the cost of storage and ethylene ripening would have made them unaffordable.</p>
<p>Tinned food had started to be available but wasn't often used, at least not in my family. Tin openers in those days were absolutely atrocious. The crank part was small and made of metal. It was hard to turn and cut into your fingers when you opened a can. It wasn't until at least well into the 1970s as far as I remember when some bright spark thought of making a tin opener that wasn't a nightmare to use.</p>
<p>Ready meals didn't exist as far as I remember. Few would have been able to afford them. People still knew how to cook and so could easily and cheaply cook something far nicer than a ready meal.</p>
<p>Meat and fish that was pre-packed in protective environments on supermarket shelves didn't exist as far as I remember. There were butchers and fishmongers who sold fresh produce. Even a small village would have a butcher. Now they've all closed down and it's hard enough to find a butcher even in a big city.</p>
<p>Frozen food existed but it wasn't really a thing until deep freezes became trendy in the late 1970s. Fridges in those days were tiny compared to nowadays and had an even tinier freezer compartment that was really just for making ice. You could maybe get a pack of frozen peas in there too at a push.</p>
<p>People ate 3 meals a day and there wasn't much snacking because there generally wasn't anything to snack on. You had to wait until the meal had been cooked. You might have a packet of crisps, some toast or some biscuits in between meals if you were particularly hungry. I would start getting pretty hungry an hour or so before lunch and supper and then I'd eat until I was full.</p>
<p>Sugar was eaten in moderation. Lunch and supper would typically end with a dessert of some sort. You might put some sugar on your cornflakes at breakfast and people often put sugar in their tea or coffee. Artificial sweeteners existed but were expensive and rarely used and I don't thing things like high fructose corn syrup were at all prevalent.</p>
<p>Fizzy drinks (soda) existed but weren't often drunk because they were too expensive. People drank water, milk, tea, coffee, orange squash and alcohol, and that was about it.</p>
<p>Bread was very much a staple. Every house had a toaster. Factory-made ready-sliced bread existed and was widely eaten. Worries about gluten were unheard of. People spread butter on their bread. Margarine started to be used much later under the belief that butter was unhealthy and margarine was healthier. This belief is entirely wrong in my opinion, by the way. Butter is absolutely allowed, indeed encouraged, on The Fresh Food Diet and margarine is forbidden. As for bread, I'm not sure. I do sometimes react to bread but not always. I think bread may be made very differently nowadays to how it was made when I was young, so it may have been better back then than it is now. I do eat bread though and it's allowed on the diet. Brown bread was quite rare when I was young - people mostly ate white bread. I prefer brown bread myself and it is said to be healthier but I don't know. There are potential issues with anti-nutrients such as lectins. I don't think that this is an area that it very well understood. Sour-dough bread wasn't a thing in England although I think it might have been in other countries that also had good health. Sour-dough is likely to contain a lot of biogenic amines and so it is risky, but on the other hand it's been eaten for thousands of years so maybe our bodies recognise it and are able to neutralise the amines. I really don't know. Jam, marmalade, Marmite and peanut butter were popular spreads but these are quite risky I think from a biogenic amine point of view, particularly peanut butter. I love bread, butter and peanut butter but tend to only eat them occasionally on special occasions.</p>
<p>Microwaves existed but almost no one had one. There was nothing to use them for and most people couldn't afford one anyway. Families cooked their meals from raw ingredients using their cookers and ate the meal straight afterwards. On a rare occasion that there was food left over until the next day, you heated it up in an oven or a saucepan. Microwaves were actually frowned upon back then. If you did eat out at a restaurant and they heated up your food in a microwave, it was considered that you'd been cheated.</p>

<h2 id="cats">Cats</h2>
<p>I once saw a veterinary website (which unfortunately I can no longer find) that showed that cats have seen an increase in the so-called diseases of industrialization on more-or-less the same scale and in more-or-less the same time frames as humans. Obesity, heart disease and cancers for example have increased in cats in much the same way as in humans.</p>
<p>It could be a coincidence that both humans and cats went for tens of thousands of years without these problems and then suddenly started having them at the same time but for completely different reasons. But it seems more likely to me that the causes for both are the same.</p>
<p>If so, it could be considered quite helpful in narrowing down the causes of the increase in chronic disease because cats eat a much narrower range of foods. They basically eat meat and not much else. They don't tend to even like sugar.</p>
<p>The only real difference in the diet of cats is that they've gone from eating fresh meat from a butcher to eating tinned meat. Tinned meat most likely contains high levels of biogenic amines whereas fresh meat generally wouldn't.</p>
<p>The manufacturers of tinned meat will certainly try to produce a product that cats will find compelling, so the theory of addictive/compelling food is quite plausible too. But the issue with this theory in my opinion is that it isn't very clear where the inflammation is coming from: if a food isn't inflammatory in small quantities, why would it be inflammatory in large quantities? Whereas the inflammatory nature of biogenic amines is very clear and well understood.</p>
<p>So I think that the most likely explanation for the increase in chronic diseases in cats is the biogenic amines in tinned cat food.</p>
