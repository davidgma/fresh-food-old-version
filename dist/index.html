<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Over the past 200 years, and particularly over the past 40, there has been a dramatic increase in a wide range of chronic diseases that were rare before, including heart disease, obesity, cancer, auto-immune diseases and depression. These are sometimes called the diseases of industrialization but they could equally well be called the diseases of chronic inflammation and this tends to accompany them. Scientists do not know what has caused this increase. We do know that in that time we have gone from eating fresh, in-season, local produce prepared in our own kitchens to eating mostly commercially-prepared food with longer shelf lives. My theory is that the cause of the increase has 2 parts. First, our diets have damaged the integrity of our gut lining so that molecules in our diets are able to pass into the blood stream that previously could not. Second, the molecules that are causing the most harm are amines such as histamine. Previously our diets would have contained almost none of these, and now, due to modern techniques to extend the shelf lives of food, they contain very high levels. This diet aims to address these 2 parts.</p>
<p>It mainly involves eating fresh food, but what constitutes fresh is quite strict - some foods considered fresh by many people are forbidden.</p>
<p>It does not involve going hungry - it is not a calorie-controlled diet; you can eat as much as you like. But it does require self-discipline, at least initially, because for most people it probably involves a complete change of eating habits, more difficultly shopping, more time spent cooking and the foregoing of many compelling foods.</p>
<p>It also involves various other behaviours which I consider healthy.</p>
<p>I personally follow this diet and it seems to work for me. According to my genetic analysis on the website <a href="https://www.23andme.com">23andMe.com</a>, I am predisposed to weigh 190 pounds (86kg, 13 stone 8) whereas I actually weigh 140 pounds (63kg, 10 stone). According to an MRI scan I have zero detectable calcified plaque in my heart and arteries, and my blood test levels for inflammation are always low.</p>
<p>Whether it works for anyone else or not - I don't know. But I wanted to set out my diet in case anyone else wants to try it or might find it interesting. You might consider trying <a href="practice.html#three_day">The 3-day Test</a>. But please note <a href="#disclaimer">the disclaimer</a>.</p>
<p>Also, it is a low histamine/low biogenic amine diet, so anyone who, like me, has histamine intolerance, may find it interesting.</p>

<h2 id="the-main-diet-rules">The Main Diet Rules</h2>
<p>These are the main rules to follow for the diet.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="practice.html#micronutrients">Ensure you get all the required micronutrients in your diet.</a></li>
<li><a href="practice.html#compulsive">Avoid foods that cause compulsive eating</a>.</li>
<li><a href="practice.html#microbiome">Maintain a healthy microbiome</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#gut">Maintain a healthy gut lining</a></li>
<li>Eat only foods that are genuinely fresh, <a href="#fresh_rules">as defined in this diet</a>.</li>
<li><a href="practice.html#exercise">Get enough exercise</a>.</li>
<li><a href="practice.html#sun">Get some exposure to the sun</a> at least a few times during the year at a safe level but without sunblock or moisturiser.</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="fresh_rules"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-fresh-food-rules">The Fresh Food Rules</h2>
<p>These are the rules for what counts as genuinely fresh food.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="practice.html#tinned">Tinned/canned/jarred foods are forbidden</a>.</li>
<li><a href="practice.html#packaging">Foods that are kept fresh-tasting by the packaging are forbidden</a> (with some exceptions).</li>
<li><a href="practice.html#ingredients">Foods with an ingredients list of more than 1 item are forbidden</a> (with some exceptions).</li>
<li><a href="practice.html#frozen">Foods that have been frozen</a> for more than 2 weeks are forbidden.</li>
<li><a href="practice.html#ripened">Artificially ripened foods are forbidden</a>. In practice this means that foods must be either (i) local and in-season, or (ii) organic, from a country that is fairly close and in-season in that country.</li>
<li>Foods that require a <a href="practice.html#preparation">preparation process</a> that has only become available within the last 200 years are forbidden.</li>
<li>Foods with a <a href="practice.html#shelf_life">shelf life</a> of more than 2 weeks, except where they are completely dry, or are entirely either fat or sugar, are forbidden.</li>
<li><a href="practice.html#fermented">Fermented foods</a> are not recommended except in small quantities or infrequently.</li>
<li><a href="practice.html#smoked">Smoked foods</a> are forbidden.</li>
<li>Everything else is allowed.</li>
</ol>
<p>It may seem like hardly anything is allowed on the diet, but that is really more of a reflection of the state the world has got to where only processed and long-life foods are eaten.</p>
<p>You can eat fresh in-season fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, shellfish, eggs, butter, cream, home-made bone stock, grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, olive oil, coconut oil, herbs, spices and seaweed. You can eat small amounts of pickles or sauerkraut. You can eat at restaurants where they cook local in-season food from fresh. Sugar, particularly brown sugar or molasses, in moderation is allowed so you can eat home-made desserts. People ate these foods quite happily for thousands of years until recently and the enormous diversity of world cuisines evolved from eating only these foods.</p>
