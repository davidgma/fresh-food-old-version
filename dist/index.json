	"content": " The Fresh Food Diet This is a diet based on a combination of:\n Several fairly widely-accepted, although not exactly mainstream, concepts about the recent rise of obesity and other chronic illnesses. An entirely unproven theory of my own about biogenic amines that I\u0026rsquo;ve never heard anyone else suggest, is contradictory to mainstream theory and therefore quite possibly wrong. A \u0026lsquo;broken mechanism\u0026rsquo;-based approach to looking at obesity and other diseases of industrialisation.  It involves eating fresh food, but what constitutes fresh is quite strict - some foods considered fresh by many people are forbidden.\nIt does not involve going hungry - it is not a calorie-controlled diet. You can eat as much as you like. But it does require self-discipline, at least initially, because for most people it probably involves a complete change of eating habits, more difficult shopping, more time spent cooking and the foregoing of many compelling foods.\nIt also involves various other behaviours which I consider healthy.\nI personally follow this diet and it seems to work for me. According to my genetic analysis on the website 23andMe, I am predisposed to weigh 190 pounds (86kg, 13 stone 8) whereas I actually weigh 145 pounds (66kg, 10 stone 5). According to an MRI scan I have zero detectable calcified plaque in my heart and arteries, and my blood test levels for inflammation are always low.\nWhether it works for anyone else or not - I don\u0026rsquo;t know. But I wanted to set out my diet in case anyone else wants to try it. But if you do, please note The Mother Of All Disclaimers.\n"
