	"content": " Introduction My theory, and it is only a theory, is that dietary biogenic amines pass from the gut into the bloodstream in between 60% and 100% of people, and not between 2% and 5% as is the mainstream view.\nThis might seem like a minor detail of no real significance, but in fact it is hugely significant. If this theory is true, everything changes. The vast majority of foods available in a typical supermarket, including foods currently considered healthy, would instead be considered unhealthy and would probably end up being banned by governments. The entire processed food industry would be under threat. There would be an additional and major plausible explanation for the surge in chronic disease over the last 40 years or so and an additional and powerful course of action available to those who care about their health.\nGiven the significance of this point, I think that it is surprising that, as far as I can tell, it has rarely been studied. I could only find 2 very small studies about it on Pubmed (a repository of scientific studies). These, taken together, suggest that biogenic amines do pass into the bloodstream in between 60% and 100% of people.\nLet me explain.\nHistamine Intolerance - What is accepted by the mainstream. Let me start with an overview of histamine intolerance - a condition I personally suffer from - because it sets out what is accepted by the mainstream scientists and doctors.\nHistamine intolerance is an officially-recognised condition that is based on the following 3 accepted facts.\n Many modern foods, unlike those eaten by our ancestors, contain relatively large quantities of histamine and other so-called \u0026lsquo;biogenic amines\u0026rsquo; - molecules that are used internally as a signalling chemical for various purposes by many species including humans. The majority of methods that allow foods to have a longer shelf life and be available out of season cause biogenic amines to be created in the foods. If the histamine and other biogenic amines were to pass from the foods in our digestive systems into the blood stream, it would be expected to cause health issues because various parts of the body would respond to their signalling effects but the signalling would be unwanted because it had come from foods and not from the body\u0026rsquo;s own signalling mechanisms. Biogenic amines are known to be involved in stimulating inflammation, pulling calcium out of bones, regulating the sleep-wake cycle and regulating digestion. The digestive system neutralizes the biogenic amines with a chemical called DAO so that they do not pass into the blood stream and do not cause these signalling problems. But in between 2% and 5% of people, this neutralization process is inadequate and biogenic amines do pass into the bloodstream and do cause signalling problems and corresponding health problems.  "

	"content": " The Fresh Food Diet This is a diet based on a combination of:\n Several fairly widely-accepted, although not exactly mainstream, concepts about the recent rise of obesity and other chronic illnesses. An entirely unproven theory of my own about biogenic amines that I\u0026rsquo;ve never heard anyone else suggest, is contradictory to mainstream theory and is therefore quite possibly wrong. A \u0026lsquo;broken mechanism\u0026rsquo;-based approach to looking at obesity and other diseases of industrialisation. Again, this is my own approach and in some aspects it is somewhat contrary to mainstream theory and in others it is more in line.  It mainly involves eating fresh food, but what constitutes fresh is quite strict - some foods considered fresh by many people are forbidden.\nIt does not involve going hungry - it is not a calorie-controlled diet; you can eat as much as you like. But it does require self-discipline, at least initially, because for most people it probably involves a complete change of eating habits, more difficultly shopping, more time spent cooking and the foregoing of many compelling foods.\nIt also involves various other behaviours which I consider healthy.\nI personally follow this diet and it seems to work for me. According to my genetic analysis on the website 23andMe.com, I am predisposed to weigh 190 pounds (86kg, 13 stone 8) whereas I actually weigh 145 pounds (66kg, 10 stone 5). According to an MRI scan I have zero detectable calcified plaque in my heart and arteries, and my blood test levels for inflammation are always low.\nWhether it works for anyone else or not - I don\u0026rsquo;t know. But I wanted to set out my diet in case anyone else wants to try it or might find it interesting. But if anyone does, please note The Mother Of All Disclaimers.\nAlso, it is a low histamine diet, so anyone who, like me, has histamine intolerance, may find it interesting.\n"

	"content": "These are the rules for what counts as genuinely fresh food. Each rule is covered in more detail on this website, including many exceptions to the rules.\n Tinned/canned/jarred foods are forbidden. Foods that are kept fresh by the packaging, such as using a modified atmosphere, are forbidden. Foods with an ingredients list of more than 1 item are forbidden. Foods that have been frozen for more than 2 weeks are forbidden. Artificially ripened foods are forbidden. In practice this means that foods must be either (i) local and in-season, or (ii) organic, from a country that is fairly close and in-season in that country. Foods that require a preparation process that has only become available within the last 200 years are forbidden. Foods with a shelf life of more than a month, except where they are completely dry, are forbidden. Fermented foods are forbidden. Smoked foods are forbidden. Everything else is allowed.  It may seem like hardly anything is allowed on the diet, but that is really more of a reflection of the state the world has got to where only processed and long-life foods are eaten.\nYou can eat fresh in-season fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, shellfish, eggs, butter, cream, home-made bone stock, grains, legumes, nuts, seeds and seaweed. You can eat at restaurants where they cook local in-season food from fresh. Sugar, particularly brown sugar or molasses, in moderation is allowed so you can eat home-made desserts. People ate these foods quite happily for thousands of years until recently and the enormous diversity of world cuisines evolved from eating only these foods.\n"

	"content": "It is a fundamental part of this diet that sufficient micronutrients must be consumed. But exactly how much of each micronutrient is needed is a lot less clear-cut than you might think. On the one hand, some doctors pooh-pooh the idea that a healthy person in the developed world could be deficient in any micronutrient at all. On the other hand the US government recommends daily intakes that are generally far higher than those of other countries\u0026rsquo; governments.\nTake the example of potassium. According to the US government fact sheet only 400 - 800 mg of potassium are needed daily for an adult to maintain enough potassium in the body, assuming they are starting from a point of adequate potassium in their body and they don\u0026rsquo;t have any potassium-depleting illnesses such as diarrhoea. Another study referenced on this website found that potassium deficiencies are rarely caused by a lack of potassium in the diet but rather by specific potassium-depleting diseases.\nSo you might reasonably think that the recommended daily intake for a healthy adult would be at least 400 mg per day and no more than 800 mg per day (as a minimum - more than this is fine). Yet the US recommends a minimum of 4,700 mg of potassium per day. The UK recommends 3,500 mg. The fact sheet referenced above accepts that there is insufficient evidence to recommended a daily intake. My guess is that this is because it is, in practice, very hard to eat less than the 800 mg needed and they probably couldn\u0026rsquo;t find any examples of healthy people with a potassium deficiency. The figure of 4,700 mg is the \u0026lsquo;adequate intake\u0026rsquo; - the amount with which nutritional adequacy is ensured. Well, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t dispute that nutritional adequacy is very likely ensured at that intake level.\nIn a world where everyone had unlimited money to spend on food and loved root vegetables, putting the recommended intake for potassium so high wouldn\u0026rsquo;t matter. But the reality is that many people, even in developed countries, do struggle financially and don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily want to eat large amounts of root vegetables every day. And vegetables are expensive per calorie. Cheaper foods like oats and lentils contain easily enough potassium to meet the 800 mg a day target but not nearly enough to make the 4,700 mg target.\nUltimately, it is a personal decision what level to aim for. If you want to be absolutely sure you are getting enough micronutrients, by all means aim for the US recommended levels. Personally, I prefer to spend less money and have a greater variety in what I eat, so I aim to get at least 800 mg of potassium, which is extremely easy to do (in practice I exceed this by a long way) and I don\u0026rsquo;t stress over trying to get 3,500 mg.\n"
