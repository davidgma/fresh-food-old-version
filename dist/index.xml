      <description>It is widely accepted that there are certain micronutrients - vitamins and minerals - that are needed for the body to function correctly.</description>

      <title>Histamine Intolerance</title>

      <description>Histamine Intolerance - What is accepted by the mainstream. Let me start with an overview of histamine intolerance - a condition I personally suffer from - because it sets out what is accepted by the mainstream scientists and doctors.
Histamine intolerance is an officially-recognised condition that is based on the following 3 accepted facts.
 Many modern foods, unlike those eaten by our ancestors, contain relatively large quantities of histamine and other so-called &amp;lsquo;biogenic amines&amp;rsquo; - molecules that are used internally as a signalling chemical for various purposes by many species including humans.</description>

      <title>The Human study</title>
      <link>https://davidgma.github.io/fresh-food/2_theory/2_3_amines/2_human_study/</link>

      <description>Given the enormous repercussions should it be the case that biogenic amines in food do pass into the bloodstream of most people, it is surprisingly hard to find any evidence one way or the other. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have been studied much.
I suspect this is because, as only about 1% of people show symptoms of histamine intolerance, it is simply assumed that everyone else is able to fully neutralize biogenic amines.</description>

      <title>The Main Diet Rules</title>
      <link>https://davidgma.github.io/fresh-food/overview/main_rules/</link>

      <guid>https://davidgma.github.io/fresh-food/overview/main_rules/</guid>
      <description>These are the main rules to follow for the diet. They are each covered in detail on this website.
 Ensure you get all the required micronutrients in your diet. Avoid foods that cause compulsive eating. Maintain a healthy microbiome. Eat only foods that are genuinely fresh, as defined in this diet. Get enough exercise. Get some exposure to the sun at least a few times during the year at a safe level but without sunblock or moisturiser.</description>

      <title>The Pig study</title>
      <link>https://davidgma.github.io/fresh-food/2_theory/2_3_amines/3_pig_study/</link>

      <description>There was also a study of pigs where they gave some pigs a dose of histamine and some of the pigs also were given a substance to block their production of DAO. DAO is what pigs (and humans) naturally produce to neutralise biogenic amines such as histamine in their digestive systems to stop it going into their bloodstreams. The pigs with the blocked DAO production had severely raised levels of histamine in their blood.</description>

      <title>Introduction</title>

      <description>It is a fundamental part of this diet that sufficient micronutrients must be consumed. But exactly how much of each micronutrient is needed is a lot less clear-cut than you might think. On the one hand, some doctors pooh-pooh the idea that a healthy person in the developed world could be deficient in any micronutrient at all. On the other hand the US government recommends daily intakes that are generally far higher than those of other countries&amp;rsquo; governments.</description>

      <title>The Fresh Food Rules</title>
      <link>https://davidgma.github.io/fresh-food/overview/fresh_rules/</link>

      <guid>https://davidgma.github.io/fresh-food/overview/fresh_rules/</guid>
      <description>These are the rules for what counts as genuinely fresh food. Each rule is covered in more detail on this website, including many exceptions to the rules.
 Tinned/canned/jarred foods are forbidden. Foods that are kept fresh by the packaging, such as using a modified atmosphere, are forbidden. Foods with an ingredients list of more than 1 item are forbidden. Foods that have been frozen for more than 2 weeks are forbidden.</description>

      <title>Vitamin C</title>
      <link>https://davidgma.github.io/fresh-food/practice/rdi/2_vitaminc/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2019 13:46:36 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidgma.github.io/fresh-food/practice/rdi/2_vitaminc/</guid>
      <description>The recommended daily intake (RDI) in the UK is 40 mg per day and in the US it is 90 mg. So if I go on holiday to the US, do I need to get more than twice the amount of vitamin C in my diet while I&amp;rsquo;m there? Of course not. US RDIs do tend to be far higher than any other country. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why this is. Perhaps the supplement industry lobbies more aggressively in the US.</description>

      <title>Vitamin B3 - Niacin</title>
      <link>https://davidgma.github.io/fresh-food/practice/rdi/4_b3/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2019 14:39:47 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidgma.github.io/fresh-food/practice/rdi/4_b3/</guid>
      <description>The recommended daily intake for vitamin B3 is 16.5 mg in the UK and 16 mg in the US. The Linus Pauling Institute suggests that 12 mg may be enough. The NHS site says &amp;lsquo;You should be able to get all the niacin you need from your daily diet&amp;rsquo;. This is particularly true because the body can convert the amino acid tryptophan into vitamin B3 at the ratio of 60 mg of tryptophan to 1 mg of vitamin B3.</description>

      <title>Calcium</title>
      <link>https://davidgma.github.io/fresh-food/practice/rdi/3_calcium/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2019 17:13:39 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://davidgma.github.io/fresh-food/practice/rdi/3_calcium/</guid>
      <description>The recommended daily intake for calcium for different countries varies mostly from 400 mg per day to 800 mg per day. The World Health Organisation recommends 400-500 mg per day. In the UK it is 700 mg per day. As usual, the US has a far higher RDI than everyone else at 1000 mg per day. One of the reasons that there is a variation, beyond the power of supplements lobbyists, is the source of the calcium.</description>
