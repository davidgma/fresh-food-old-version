<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Over the past 200 years, and particularly over the past 40, there has been a dramatic increase in a wide range of chronic diseases that were rare before, including heart disease, obesity, cancer, auto-immune diseases and depression. These are sometimes called the diseases of industrialization but they could equally well be called the diseases of chronic inflammation as this tends to accompany them. Scientists do not know what has caused this increase. We do know that in that time we have gone from eating fresh, in-season, local produce prepared in our own kitchens to eating mostly commercially-prepared food with longer shelf lives. My theory is that the cause of the increase has 2 parts. First, our diets have damaged the integrity of our gut lining so that molecules in our diets are able to pass into the blood stream that previously could not. Second, the molecules that are causing the most harm are amines such as histamine. Previously our diets would have contained almost none of these, and now, due to modern techniques to extend the shelf lives of food, they contain very high levels. This diet aims to address these 2 parts.</p>
<p>It mainly involves eating fresh food, but what constitutes fresh is quite strict - some foods considered fresh by many people are forbidden.</p>
<p>It does not involve going hungry - it is not a calorie-controlled diet; you can eat as much as you like. But it does require self-discipline, at least initially, because for most people it probably involves a complete change of eating habits, more difficultly shopping, more time spent cooking and the foregoing of many compelling foods.</p>
<p>It also involves various other behaviours which I consider healthy.</p>
<p>I personally follow this diet and it seems to work for me. According to my genetic analysis on the website <a href="https://www.23andme.com">23andMe.com</a>, I am predisposed to weigh 190 pounds (86kg, 13 stone 8) whereas I actually weigh 140 pounds (63kg, 10 stone). According to an MRI scan I have zero detectable calcified plaque in my heart and arteries, and my blood test levels for inflammation are always low.</p>
<p>Whether it works for anyone else or not - I don't know. But I wanted to set out my diet in case anyone else wants to try it or might find it interesting. You might consider trying <a href="#three_day">The 3-day Test</a>. But please note <a href="#disclaimer">the disclaimer</a>.</p>
<p>Also, it is a low histamine/low biogenic amine diet, so anyone who, like me, has histamine intolerance, may find it interesting.</p>

<p>These are the rules for what counts as genuinely fresh food.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#tinned">Tinned/canned/jarred foods are forbidden</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#packaging">Foods that are kept fresh-tasting by the packaging are forbidden</a> (with some exceptions).</li>

<p>It may seem like hardly anything is allowed on the diet, but that is really more of a reflection of the state the world has got to where only processed and long-life foods are eaten.</p>
<p>You can eat fresh in-season fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, shellfish, eggs, butter, cream, home-made bone stock, grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, olive oil, coconut oil, herbs, spices and seaweed. You can eat small amounts of pickles or sauerkraut. You can eat at restaurants where they cook local in-season food from fresh. Sugar, particularly brown sugar or molasses, in moderation is allowed so you can eat home-made desserts. People ate these foods quite happily for thousands of years until recently and the enormous diversity of world cuisines evolved from eating only these foods.</p>

<p>If not, you could read more about the <a href="#practice">practice</a> of the diet.</p>
<h1 id="theory">Theory</h1>
<p>This section sets out the theories behind the main diet rules and the fresh food rules.</p>
<p>You don't need to read any of this if you aren't interested. You can skip to the practical details section.</p>
<p>In the past 200 or so years, and especially in the past 40 years, there has been a huge increase in certain diseases. They broadly fit into the following categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some cancers</li>
<li>Cardiovascular diseases (e.g. heart disease and stroke)</li>
<li>Metabolic syndrome diseases (e.g. weight gain, obesity, diabetes)</li>
<li>Autoimmune diseases</li>
<li>Cognitive diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's Disease)</li>
<li>Neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g. eating disorders, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety)</li>
</ol>
<p>These diseases are sometimes collectively called the 'diseases of industrialization'. Many of them could equally well be called the diseases of inflammation as chronic inflammation is common to many of them.</p>
<p>Researchers have been trying to work out why this has happened, and they are still not sure. All that is known for sure is that we went from eating fresh, local, in-season produce, prepared in our own kitchens, to eating food with long shelf lives that is produced and prepared elsewhere. Most researchers, as far as I can tell, agree that some aspects of this have caused the problems. But no one really knows exactly what the aspects are, advice on what to do has been astoundingly unsuccessful and there isn't really a very good explanation for exactly what is causing the chronic inflammation.</p>
<p>My theory is that the chronic inflammation, as well as various other problems, are caused by dietary biogenic amines passing from the digestive system into the bloodstream. This is contrary to mainstream theory which says that dietary biogenic amines are fully neutralised in the digestive system.</p>
<h2 id="biogenic-amines---my-theory">Biogenic Amines - My Theory</h2>
<p>So my theory, and it is only a theory, is that dietary biogenic amines pass from the digestive system into the bloodstream in between 60% and 100% of people, and not <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/85/5/1185/4633007">1%</a> as is the mainstream view.</p>
<p>This might seem like a minor detail of no real significance, but in fact it is hugely significant. If this theory is true, everything changes. The vast majority of foods available in a typical supermarket, including foods currently considered healthy, would instead be considered unhealthy and would probably end up being banned by governments. The entire processed food industry would be under threat. There would be an additional and major plausible explanation for the surge in chronic disease over the last 40 years or so and an additional and powerful course of action available to those who care about their health.</p>
<p>Given the significance of this point, I think that it is surprising that, as far as I can tell, it has rarely been studied. I could only find 2 very small studies about it on Pubmed (a repository of scientific studies). These, taken together, suggest that biogenic amines do pass into the bloodstream in between 60% and 100% of people.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<h2 id="histamine-intolerance">Histamine Intolerance</h2>
<p>Let me start with an overview of histamine intolerance - a condition I personally suffer from - because it sets out what is accepted by the mainstream scientists and doctors.</p>
<p>Histamine intolerance is an officially-recognised condition that is based on the following 3 accepted facts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Many modern foods, unlike those eaten by our ancestors, contain relatively large quantities of histamine and other so-called 'biogenic amines' - molecules that are used internally as a signalling chemical for various purposes by many species including humans. The majority of methods that allow foods to have a longer shelf life and be available out of season cause biogenic amines to be created in the foods. The biogenic amines are created as a by-product of microbial activity and increase over time; when the food is first harvested/killed it contains negligible quantities of biogenic amines.</li>
<li>If the histamine and other biogenic amines were to pass from the foods in our digestive systems into the blood stream, it would be expected to cause health issues because various parts of the body would respond to their signalling effects but the signalling would be unwanted because it had come from foods and not from the body's own signalling mechanisms. Biogenic amines are known to be involved in stimulating inflammation, pulling calcium out of bones, regulating the sleep-wake cycle, mediating neuronal signalling and regulating digestion.</li>
<li>The digestive system neutralizes the biogenic amines with a chemical called DAO so that they do not pass into the blood stream and do not cause these signalling problems. But in 1% of people, this neutralization process is inadequate and biogenic amines do pass into the bloodstream and do cause signalling problems and corresponding health problems. This 1% of people are said to have histamine intolerance.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is this final part that is wrong according to my theory. It is instead between 60% and 100% of people that cannot neutralize all of the biogenic amines in food and this leads to a large variety of potential health problems including chronic inflammation, calcium metabolism disorders, digestive disorders and sleep disorders. Chronic inflammation then contributes strongly to one or more of: weight gain, heart disease, cancer, auto-immune diseases and cognitive diseases.</p>
<p>I don't know why exactly biogenic amines don't get fully neutralized in the digestive system. I don't dispute that the body has a mechanism, via DAO, to neutralize them. I think it is likely that it is due to one or more of the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>We have damaged our guts such that the gut lining lets through molecules that it shouldn't, including histamine and other amines. This seems by far the most likely reason to me.</li>
<li>The sheer volume of biogenic amines we consume nowadays is too much for the body's neutralization system to cope with and it gets overwhelmed.</li>
<li>The neutralization of biogenic amines with DAO only happens where the food is one which we have been eating as a species for a long time in a form that contains biogenic amines so that the body recognises the food and knows to neutralize the biogenic amines. Modern methods of food production have resulted in a large number of foods containing biogenic amines that would never have contained them before, particularly during our evolution as a species, and so our bodies do not expect them to have biogenic amines and do not neutralize them.</li>
<li>We have damaged our body's mechanism for neutralising biogenic amines, for example by taking certain medications that suppress the production of DAO or by damaging our gut microbiome.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-human-study">The Human study</h2>
<p>Given the enormous repercussions should it be the case that biogenic amines in food do pass into the bloodstream of most people, it is surprisingly hard to find any evidence one way or the other. It doesn't seem to have been studied much.</p>
<p>I suspect this is because, as only about 1% of people show symptoms of histamine intolerance, it is simply assumed that everyone else is able to fully neutralize biogenic amines. But as biogenic amines attach to cells in the body (this is how they carry out their signalling function) it is possible that in most people the biogenic amines get attached to cells in the heart, arteries and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2671373/">osteoclasts</a> or other receptors, such that the person doesn't feel anything but nevertheless in time develops diseases. It is well-established that chronic inflammation is associated with a wide range of diseases but people developing these diseases do not feel the inflammation. For example, the accumulation of plaque in people's arteries is associated with chronic inflammation yet people do not feel at all unwell until, after decades of plaque accumulation, they have a heart attack. They do not feel the inflammation. That's why people have blood tests to test for inflammation - if they could feel it they wouldn't need the test. So biogenic amines could plausibly be passing into the blood stream of most people without them feeling unwell, depending on which cells the biogenic amines mainly attached to.</p>
<p>If this were the case then histamine intolerance would probably be better characterised as a predisposition in some people for the biogenic amines to attach to receptors that produce noticeable short-term problems rather than problems that are unnoticeable in the short and medium term.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15603203">One study</a> did test whether histamine, at a normal level found in food, passed into normal people's bloodstreams. It only looked at 10 people unfortunately (plus 10 controls) so is too small a study to draw any concrete conclusions from, but it found that in 5 of the 10 people the histamine did appear to have passed into their bloodstreams as they had noticeable reactions to it whereas none of the controls had any reaction. So this 50% of the sample does massively contradict the mainstream view that only 1% of people can't fully neutralize dietary biogenic amines.</p>
<p>An interesting thing to note from this study is that none of the blood tests taken from the subjects (presumably taken from the arm) showed any raised histamine level, even in the subjects that had a noticeable histamine reaction. This suggests that all the molecules of histamine that did get into the bloodstream had attached to a cell receptor before the blood got to the arm. This might offer another explanation of why the mainstream view is that only 1% of people can't fully neutralize the dietary biogenic amines - any studies conducted by giving subjects a dose of histamine and then looking for changes in blood levels of histamine would find no raised histamine level and then conclude that there was no histamine passing into the bloodstream.</p>
<h2 id="the-pig-study">The Pig study</h2>
<p>There was also a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3134804">study of pigs</a> where they gave some pigs a dose of histamine and some of the pigs also were given a substance to block their production of DAO. DAO is what pigs (and humans) naturally produce to neutralise biogenic amines such as histamine in their digestive systems to stop it going into their bloodstreams.</p>
<p>As noted above, my theory is that humans may only be able to neutralise biogenic amines in foods that they have evolved eating in a form that contains biogenic amines, such as red meat that has been hung for several days or small quantities of fermented foods. In general, I don't think humans evolved eating many foods that contain biogenic amines because they evolved eating fresh local in-season food. Domestic pigs on the other hand, have in effect evolved (via selective breading by humans) to eat pig swill, which is basically old human food, which would have contained a lot of biogenic amines, and so I think that pigs are naturally far better at neutralising biogenic amines than humans.</p>
<p>The pigs with the blocked DAO production had severely raised levels of histamine in their blood. Although this isn't in itself surprising, the authors noted that 20% of humans eat or drink things that similarly block DAO production and so they suggested that histamine from food getting into the bloodstream in humans is likely to be a problem.</p>
<p>Both this pig study and the human study discussed previously are very small and so you can't draw very solid conclusions from them. But I couldn't find any other studies on the subject.</p>
<p>My estimate of 60% to 100% of humans being unable to stop biogenic amines in food from getting into their bloodstreams comes from these studies so it's really a very wild guess. The 60% is made up of the 50% of humans that had reactions to the histamine in the human study, plus 20% of the remaining 50% who might be taking DOA inhibiting substances.</p>
<p>The 100% is based on the possibility that no humans can stop all biogenic amines getting into their blood streams and the reason that the 50% in the human study didn't show any reaction is that the histamine molecules all attached to cells whose response couldn't be felt, such as cells in the heart and artery walls and cells in osteoclasts.</p>
<h2 id="the-book-trace-amines-and-neurological-disorders">The book 'Trace Amines and Neurological Disorders'</h2>
<p>There is actually a book that has been published called 'Trace Amines and Neurological Disorders: Potential Mechanisms and Risk Factors' by Tahira Farooqui and Akhlaq A. Farooqui which also indirectly supports my theory.</p>
<p>They weren't looking at the diseases of industrialisation in general, but neurological disorders in particular. I haven't read the book, but there are some extracts of it available on the internet. Here are some of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...in a diverse array of human pathologies ranging from substance abuse, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, schizophrenia, and other neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, the levels of trace amines are unusually high with an imbalance in their functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Biogenic amines have been shown to occur in various foods like fish, meat, cheese, vegetables, and wines.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...Biogenic amines may thus enter the bloodstream postprandially.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So they are basically saying that in people with the various diseases they list, they have unusually high levels of biogenic amines in their body and they suspect that these higher levels come from eating foods that are high in biogenic amines.</p>
<p>The reason that I think that the findings can be applicable beyond just neurological disorders is that biogenic amines can potentially attach to a very wide range of cells in the body, and the exact cells that the molecules attach to will determine the disease. Studies have shown that even in a particular individual, the cells that histamine molecules attach to can vary from one day to another. So I don't think it is unreasonable to assume that different individuals may have different predispositions for which cells biogenic amines will attach to.</p>
<p>For example, if biogenic amine molecules tend to attach themselves to histamine receptors in an artery, it might trigger inflammation. Over a period of regularly eating foods high in biogenic amines, the person might get heart disease. Similarly, if the molecules tend to attach to osteoclast receptors, they might end up with osteoporosis. Similarly, if they tend to attach to cell receptors in blood vessels in the head they might end up getting headaches. If they tend to attach to cell receptors that regulate the circadian rhythm then they might end up with sleep disorders. And so on. They might also get a combination of diseases where more than one type of cell receptor is attached to.</p>
<h2 id="broken-mechanisms">Broken Mechanisms</h2>
<p>In my opinion, most or all of the 'diseases of industrialisation' can be viewed as failures of mechanisms in our bodies rather than mainly the result of an external cause. This is more a way of looking at things rather than a new theory in itself.</p>
<p>The mainstream approach seems to be to treat all diseases as the result of an external cause, perhaps because, before the diseases of industrialisation, this was probably almost always the case. For example, if a person is bitten by a mosquito that passes on the parasite that causes malaria, then that parasite is the external cause of the malaria. Whether the person survives will depend on whether their immune systems can defeat the parasite.</p>
<p>However, I don't think that the diseases of industrialisation fit well into this paradigm. Our species, homo sapiens, has been around for about 200,000 to 300,000 years and it's probably only been in the last few hundred that these diseases have existed in anything other than negligible amounts and only in the last 40 or so years that they have really mushroomed.</p>
<p>The external environment has changed, but it doesn't seem to me to have changed enough to explain the rise of these diseases. The explanation that seems better to me is that mechanisms in our bodies that used to stop these diseases from ever happening have stopped working. We have broken our natural mechanisms.</p>
<p>For example, I believe that we have a natural mechanism to stop us from becoming fat. The argument that some put forward that we have evolved to put on as much weight as possible when there's enough food so as to survive in a famine does not, in my opinion, stand up at all to scrutiny. The argument is called 'the thrifty gene hypothesis' and has been very widely discredited. Instead, many experts say that we evolved in an environment with few humans and plenty of resources that our ancestors were very adept at using. Scientists studying hunter gathers reckon that it probably only took them 2 or 3 days of work a week to get all the food they needed and famines would have been rare. The Economist magazine says that famines only happen when both a natural disaster and bad government occur together. I doubt that any hunter gatherer chiefs, however bad, would have been able to contribute to a famine - they just wouldn't have had enough influence over the environment. The idea that humans have only had enough food to eat in the last 40 years, and that's why many have become so fat, doesn't even tie up with living memory. I remember 40 years ago, when almost no-one was that fat, and there was a huge middle class in Britain that had enough food to eat and didn't get fat.</p>
<p>Whereas not being fat would have been advantageous to our ancestors as it would have helped with hunting, gathering, running from wild animals and fending off rival humans. So I think it likely that we evolved to have a natural mechanism to stop us getting fat. Our appetite plays a role in this mechanism as does how energetic we feel.</p>
<p>So it seems more likely to me that where people have not stayed slim, it's because they have broken this mechanism. The answer is not to try to starve themselves when they feel ravenous and force themselves to exercise when they feel completely lethargic, because it takes more will power than people have over the long term. The answer is to fix the mechanism so that the body will naturally become slimmer by being less hungry and feeling more energetic. The person will be working with their body rather than against it.</p>
<p>It is my theory that a significant contributing factor to breaking this mechanism is chronic inflammation caused by dietary biogenic amines passing into the blood stream. I have noticed that when I have a cold I always feel hungrier and more lethargic than normal and I invariably put on weight. But then I lose that weight again very easily on recovering from the cold. It makes sense to me that when the body is under attack from a parasite it should go into a state of inflammation and take on more calories to give its immune system the best chance of defeating the parasite. So it seems likely to me that when the body is in a state of inflammation, it will naturally want to take on more calories. The problem with today's diet of foods containing biogenic amines, according to my theory, is that people have a state of permanent inflammation and so they permanently put on weight. By changing to a diet low in biogenic amines they might be able to end their chronic inflammation and their bodies might naturally lose weight as they will feel less hungry and more energetic for a time until their weight has reduced again. For a person of a healthy weight, eating extra calories will not lead to weight gain but rather to not feeling hungry for longer or feeling more energetic.</p>
<p>Another example is that of heart disease. The mainstream efforts to address this problem seem to involve looking for external causes. The idea seems to be that something external is causing problematic plaque deposits to form in the heart and arteries. Saturated fat has been suggested as a factor. However, many doctors and scientists who have studied this put up very compelling arguments as to why saturated fat is not a cause of heart disease. But what no one seems to be considering is the notion that plaques forming in the heart and arteries is completely normal and has always happened, but throughout most of human existence the body simply removed them again. What has changed might instead be that we have broken the mechanism that removes the plaques so that they keep accumulating and end up causing heart disease and strokes.</p>
<p>Here's my layman's view of inflammation and removal of debris within the body. Imagine you are bitten by a mosquito. It doesn't carry the parasite that causes malaria so you're not in any serious danger. Soon after the bite, the site of the bite swells up and becomes itchy. This is a reaction of the body to try to fight a possible infection that might arise because of the bite. The inflammation of the area helps to stop the spread of any parasites that might have been introduced. It's intentionally created by the body and the body achieves this by the release of histamine, a biogenic amine, at the local site. It may be annoying, but it's a good thing. Over the next few days, the body's immune system will go to work to make the area safe, killing any parasites it can. Once the site is safe, the swelling comes down and then, over the next few days, the site is restored to normal and looks exactly the same as before the bite happened. It seems likely to me that this final step would involve removing any debris from the site such as the immune cells that were active there. It wouldn't make sense to reduce the inflammation until the site is safe and it wouldn't make sense to remove the debris until the site is safe, so it seems plausible to me that the body would naturally not remove debris from an internal site until any inflammation has subsided.</p>
<p>My theory is that dietary biogenic amines pass into the blood stream and can attach to receptor cells in the heart and arteries and cause inflammation. Because this happens after most meals, the inflammation is chronic - it's there almost all the time for decades. So perhaps, because of the chronic inflammation, the body's natural mechanism for clearing any plaques from the heart and arteries holds off doing so, waiting for the inflammation to subside. But it never does.</p>
<h2 id="occams-razor">Occam's Razor</h2>
<p>Occam's Razor is a philosophical principal that says that the explanation that requires the fewest assumptions is usually correct.</p>
<p>Most, if not all, of the so-called diseases of industrialisation can be explained by just one assumption: that the body does not fully stop dietary biogenic amines from passing into the blood stream.</p>
<p>Biogenic amines have such an extensive signalling role within the body, including causing inflammation and regulating calcium, the circadian rhythm, digestion and cognition, that an enormous range of modern diseases could be explained by this one assumption.</p>
<p>So although Occam's Razor isn't a proof that my theory is right, it does suggest that it may well be.</p>
<h2 id="hunger-and-fatigue">Hunger and fatigue</h2>
<p>In my experience, there are broadly 2 types of hunger. There is normal hunger which comes on if it's been a while since you last ate and gets worse gradually until you eat again. Then there is an extreme type of hunger that I only get when I'm ill - for example when I have a cold. This hunger is overwhelming and compelling. Regardless of how much self control you have, there is no resisting it. Your body needs more energy to fight the infection and doesn't give you a choice. You absolutely have to eat. You can think of nothing else but your hunger.</p>
<p>When I have a cold I invariably eat more and gain a few pounds, but then once I'm over the cold I feel far less hungry and easily return to my previous weight.</p>
<p>I also feel totally exhausted when I have a cold as my body is telling me that it needs all its energy to fight the infection. The fatigue, like the hunger, is totally overwhelming and compels me to rest.</p>
<p>I don't know what it's like being someone else, but my suspicion is that for overweight people, the type of hunger they get is the second type, the overwhelming and compelling type. According to my theory, what happens is that the biogenic amines in the food they eat get into their blood stream and cause inflammation. The inflammation then causes their bodies to incorrectly assume that they have an infection to fight and so the second type of hunger is triggered, as well as the fatigue. They have no choice but to eat and rest, regardless of how much self control they have. But because they eat food that is high in biogenic amines every day, the inflammation never subsides and the extreme hunger and fatigue never go. They can see that they are eating a lot and exercising little and can also see that they are eating a lot more and exercising much less than thin people, and they assume that they have far less self control than thin people and blame themselves. Other people, both overweight and thin, think the same way and blame overweight people for lacking self control and consider their weight problem to be their own fault due to their gluttony and sloth.</p>
<p>But I don't think that overweight people do lack self control, but rather, the intensity of the hunger and fatigue they feel is so great that no one feeling the same would be able to resist eating and resting. According to my theory, following The Fresh Food Diet is the best way to solve the problem because it reduces the inflammation which then reduces the intensity of hunger to normal, resistible levels and returns energy levels to normal.</p>

<h2 id="a-trip-down-memory-lane">A Trip Down Memory Lane</h2>
<p>Many researchers study the diets and lifestyles of populations of people who lived in traditional ways that hadn't changed much for thousands, or in some cases tens of thousands, of years, and who had spectacularly good health compared to most of us nowadays. Hunter gathers are one example but there have been others such as Scottish crofters and Swiss alpine farmers. I think the information gathered from these studies is very useful in better understanding nutrition and the rise of modern diseases. One very clear similarity between all the various traditional populations is that they almost exclusively ate very fresh, local, in-season produce that they cooked themselves.</p>
<p>This approach to nutrition has many critics who argue that as most of these populations have long-since ceased to exist, we're not really sure exactly how they lived and even if we did know, the foods they ate are no longer available.</p>
<p>But we don't have to go back so far. The really dramatic rise in the chronic diseases that afflict us today has happened in the last 40 or so years. I was born into a fairly affluent middle class family in the south east of England in 1966. I remember a time when almost nobody of any age was fat yet everyone ate 3 times a day until they were full. We all ate as much as we liked and rarely got fat.</p>
<p>So I'm going to set out my memory of what we ate in those days. I was pretty young so I apologise if I've misremembered some things.</p>
<p>One thing that people often don't notice is how much richer, in absolute terms, people have become over time. Poverty is generally measured in relative terms, for example a person is considered poor if their income is more than 40% below average. With this measure, poverty is in effect a result of inequality rather than necessarily a lack of purchasing power. But in absolute terms, people have become far richer. I think I saw a study that found that the purchasing power of a family in the top 20% of income when I was young would now be approximately in the bottom 20%. Most people nowadays can afford so much stuff that almost no one could afford when I was young. For example, despite being from a fairly affluent family, I had very few clothes as a child and what I had came from jumble sales. If I go on I'll sound like the Monty Python sketch where they talk about eating cold gravel for breakfast. Life was actually pretty good (it's even better now), we just couldn't afford to buy that much stuff; almost no one could.</p>
<p>People rarely ate at restaurants or from takeaways. They couldn't afford to. You might get some fish and chips once every couple of weeks. There weren't many restaurants in those days - there just wasn't the call for them. A typical medium size town would have a 'Bernie Inn' where people might go for steak and chips as a treat to celebrate their birthday and maybe an Italian restaurant. There would be a few fish and chip shops and maybe a couple of Chinese takeaways. Nowadays the same town will have at least 20 restaurants and multiple fast food outlets.</p>
<p>Supermarkets were only just arriving. We had a lesson in primary school about what they are and the teacher pronounced 'supermarket' in an odd way. More typically, a family food shop would involve a visit to a greengrocer and a visit to a butcher. The food available was mostly local as the cost of importing exotic fruits and vegetables from overseas would have made them unaffordable.</p>
<p>The fruits and vegetables were also mostly in-season as the cost of storage and ethylene ripening would have made them unaffordable.</p>
<p>Tinned food had started to be available but wasn't often used, at least not in my family. Tin openers in those days were absolutely atrocious. The crank part was small and made of metal. It was hard to turn and cut into your fingers when you opened a can. It wasn't until at least well into the 1970s as far as I remember when some bright spark thought of making a tin opener that wasn't a nightmare to use.</p>
<p>Ready meals didn't exist as far as I remember. Few would have been able to afford them. People still knew how to cook and so could easily and cheaply cook something far nicer than a ready meal.</p>
<p>Meat and fish that was pre-packed in protective environments on supermarket shelves didn't exist as far as I remember. There were butchers and fishmongers who sold fresh produce. Even a small village would have a butcher. Now they've all closed down and it's hard enough to find a butcher even in a big city.</p>
<p>Frozen food existed but it wasn't really a thing until deep freezes became trendy in the late 1970s. Fridges in those days were tiny compared to nowadays and had an even tinier freezer compartment that was really just for making ice. You could maybe get a pack of frozen peas in there too at a push.</p>
<p>People ate 3 meals a day and there wasn't much snacking because there generally wasn't anything to snack on. You had to wait until the meal had been cooked. You might have a packet of crisps, some toast or some biscuits in between meals if you were particularly hungry. I would start getting pretty hungry an hour or so before lunch and supper and then I'd eat until I was full.</p>
<p>Sugar was eaten in moderation. Lunch and supper would typically end with a dessert of some sort. You might put some sugar on your cornflakes at breakfast and people often put sugar in their tea or coffee. Artificial sweeteners existed but were expensive and rarely used and I don't thing things like high fructose corn syrup were at all prevalent.</p>
<p>Fizzy drinks (soda) existed but weren't often drunk because they were too expensive. People drank water, milk, tea, coffee, orange squash and alcohol, and that was about it.</p>
<p>Bread was very much a staple. Every house had a toaster. Factory-made ready-sliced bread existed and was widely eaten. Worries about gluten were unheard of. People spread butter on their bread. Margarine started to be used much later under the belief that butter was unhealthy and margarine was healthier. This belief is entirely wrong in my opinion, by the way. Butter is absolutely allowed, indeed encouraged, on The Fresh Food Diet and margarine is forbidden. As for bread, I'm not sure. I do sometimes react to bread but not always. I think bread may be made very differently nowadays to how it was made when I was young, so it may have been better back then than it is now. I do eat bread though and it's allowed on the diet. Brown bread was quite rare when I was young - people mostly ate white bread. I prefer brown bread myself and it is said to be healthier but I don't know. There are potential issues with anti-nutrients such as lectins. I don't think that this is an area that it very well understood. Sour-dough bread wasn't a thing in England although I think it might have been in other countries that also had good health. Sour-dough is likely to contain a lot of biogenic amines and so it is risky, but on the other hand it's been eaten for thousands of years so maybe our bodies recognise it and are able to neutralise the amines. I really don't know. Jam, marmalade, Marmite and peanut butter were popular spreads but these are quite risky I think from a biogenic amine point of view, particularly peanut butter. I love bread, butter and peanut butter but tend to only eat them occasionally on special occasions.</p>
<p>Microwaves existed but almost no one had one. There was nothing to use them for and most people couldn't afford one anyway. Families cooked their meals from raw ingredients using their cookers and ate the meal straight afterwards. On a rare occasion that there was food left over until the next day, you heated it up in an oven or a saucepan. Microwaves were actually frowned upon back then. If you did eat out at a restaurant and they heated up your food in a microwave, it was considered that you'd been cheated.</p>
<p><a name="cats"></a></p>
<h2 id="cats">Cats</h2>
<p>I once saw a veterinary website (which unfortunately I can no longer find) that showed that cats have seen an increase in the so-called diseases of industrialization on more-or-less the same scale and in more-or-less the same time frames as humans. Obesity, heart disease and cancers for example have increased in cats in much the same way as in humans.</p>
<p>It could be a coincidence that both humans and cats went for tens of thousands of years without these problems and then suddenly started having them at the same time but for completely different reasons. But it seems more likely to me that the causes for both are the same.</p>
<p>If so, it could be considered quite helpful in narrowing down the causes of the increase in chronic disease because cats eat a much narrower range of foods. They basically eat meat and not much else. They don't tend to even like sugar.</p>
<p>The only real difference in the diet of cats is that they've gone from eating fresh meat from a butcher or from their own hunting to eating tinned meat. Tinned meat most likely contains high levels of biogenic amines whereas fresh meat generally wouldn't.</p>
<p>The manufacturers of tinned cat food will certainly try to produce a product that cats will find compelling, so the theory of addictive/compulsive food is quite plausible too. But the issue with this theory in my opinion is that it isn't very clear where the inflammation is coming from: if a food isn't inflammatory in small quantities, why would it be inflammatory in large quantities? Whereas the inflammatory nature of biogenic amines is very clear and well understood. In any case, The Fresh Food Diet prohibits addictive/compulsive foods.</p>
<p>Tinned cat food also contains a similar array of artificial additives as human processed food and this is likely a contributing factor too. The Fresh Food Diet also prohibits artificial additives.</p>
<p>But I think that the most likely explanation for the increase in chronic diseases in cats is the biogenic amines in tinned cat food.</p>
<p><a name="practice"></a></p>
<h1 id="practice">Practice</h1>
<p>This section provides help as to what is allowed and what is prohibited on this diet.</p>
<p><a name="micronutrients"></a></p>
<h2 id="micronutrients">Micronutrients</h2>
<p>Getting all your required micronutrients is part of this diet. As part of my broken mechanism approach to understanding diseases of industrialisation, is seems plausible to me that all of the body's mechanisms will need the basic building blocks of micronutrients to work properly. In any case, it is clear that getting sufficient micronutrients is necessary for good health.</p>
<p>In general, if you are eating a balanced diet containing at least vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, and eggs, I think it likely that you will be ok. But it's a good idea to, from time to time, weigh and record everything you eat in nutrition software. I use <a href="https://cronometer.com/">cronometer</a> which is free, but there are many choices. By doing this you can get a better idea of whether or not your diet is covering all the necessary nutrients.</p>
<p>One nutrient that generally isn't covered in nutrition software but is very important is iodine. Some studies have suggested that iodine deficiency is a widespread problem even in developed countries like Britain. I think it's a good idea to include some arame dried seaweed in your diet. I add a small amount to soups - just a few shreds, maybe 0.1g. There is a danger of taking in too much iodine, although some scientists say that this is only an issue from artificial sources of iodine, such as pills, and that you can eat seaweed without any danger. I don't know, you may want to do some research, but about 0.1g of arame dried seaweed no more than once a day is what I do. You can use other seaweeds but it's worth checking on the internet how much iodine they contain. Some, like the nori seaweed used to make sushi, contains almost none while others can contain a huge amount.</p>
<p><a name="compulsive"></a></p>
<h2 id="compulsive-foods">Compulsive Foods</h2>
<p>There is a theory that is becoming increasingly accepted amongst obesity researchers that a significant contributing factor to the rise in levels of obesity is that foods have become more compulsive. That is, we feel a desire to eat them beyond what is necessary to provide enough calories to live. I think this theory is almost certainly right and so it forms part of the diet.</p>
<p>The idea is that as we have moved away from eating foods that were prepared in our own kitchens and instead have started to eat mostly foods that have been prepared commercially, such as ready meals, fast food and confectionery, the provision of these foods has become a competitive business. To succeed in a competitive environment, food producers have had to design their products to make them as desirable as possible. Intentionally or unintentionally, they have created foods that are, in effect, addictive. We feel compelled to eat them even when we aren't hungry. Imagine you are walking along the road and you aren't that hungry. Someone suggests to you that you might like to eat a salad. You say, "Well, actually I'm not that hungry." But if someone suggests to you that you might like some pizza, you suddenly feel a desire to eat it.</p>
<p>So we've ended up eating when we aren't hungry and so we've overridden the mechanism that would otherwise stop us eating when we had no need for the additional calories. So we've become fat.</p>
<p>I think that this theory alone could explain the rise in obesity without needing my theory about biogenic amines at all. The main aspect where I think my theory is better is that the compulsive foods theory doesn't provide a clear mechanism for creating chronic inflammation and doesn't explain all the other chronic illnesses that have become widespread over the last few decades. Whereas mine does. But I think that both are important factors.</p>
<p>Some proponents of this theory of compulsive foods talk of 'highly palatable foods' as the problem, and have sometimes adopted a policy of only eating bland and unappetising foods in order to stay slim. They equate foods that taste really nice with foods that are compulsive. I don't agree with this at all and it is absolutely not a requirement of this diet to eat bland foods.</p>
<p>I have the good fortune of having a father who is a brilliant cook. He was a restaurateur, running a restaurant that produced mainly French provincial-style cuisine (but in England). I grew up eating amazing food. I ate at the restaurant whenever I wanted to. Being the boss' son, I just showed up and asked for whatever I wanted and my father or one of the lovely chefs there would produce it. At home, my father did the cooking and his food was always delicious. For our holidays we would go on tours of France, armed with a copy of the Michelin guide, and we would visit some of the best restaurants in France. In my opinion, the French food I grew up eating tastes far nicer than any fast food hamburger, fried chicken or pizza. I wouldn't go as far as to say it tasted better than chocolate. But the interesting thing was that I never had a craving for my father's food, or any other French food, when I wasn't hungry. If my father offered me some food and I wasn't hungry, I would just say that I wasn't hungry. But I got the same cravings for junk food as anyone else. Despite the availability of amazing French food, I'm ashamed to say that I regularly ate junk food.</p>
<p>So food compulsion is not about taste in my opinion. It's about craving. My father's food tasted far better but I never craved it.</p>
<p>This diet bans the eating of foods that are compulsive, apart from perhaps very occasionally. But the test of whether a food is compulsive or not isn't based on how good it tastes. It is based on whether you have a desire for that food when you are not hungry. If you are walking down the road and you see a pizza shop and you feel an urge for some pizza, ask yourself whether you would also eat a salad or some other home-cooked food. If you find foods that you fancy eating when you aren't in the mood for eating healthy foods then you should conclude that that food is compulsive. Having concluded this, I think that it is better to, generally, never eat those foods, even when you are genuinely hungry. It is better to get over the addiction. A food should not be compulsive. Proper food, in my opinion, is desirable when you are hungry and not when you are not.</p>
<p><a name="microbiome"></a></p>
<h2 id="maintaining-a-healthy-microbiome">Maintaining a healthy microbiome</h2>
<p>Your microbiome is the set of microbes such as bacteria and yeast that co-exist with you - mainly in your digestive system but also on your skin, in your mouth, up your nose etc. Research on this subject has been mushrooming recently and the findings are that your microbiome is incredibly important for your health.</p>
<p>For example, there is compelling evidence that your microbes effect your weight. There have been experiments where they took microbes from the guts of thin mice and put them into the guts of fat mice and the fat mice became a lot thinner. There is also compelling evidence that your microbes effect your brain functioning, your immune system, your digestive system and provide vital nutrients to your body.</p>
<p>As a result of all this research, advice to maintain a healthy microbiome has now become fairly mainstream. Unfortunately, the research has yet to come up with much in the way of helpful recommendations on how to do this. So I've included this requirement as part of the diet more in the hope that one day it will be clearer what needs to be done rather than because there's much that can be done about it with any certainty now.</p>
<p>It is clear from the research that, to have a healthy microbiome, it is a good idea to be born naturally rather than by a caesarian delivery, it is good to be fed breast milk rather than formula as a baby and to avoid having your appendix removed. If you can live as a hunter-gather on the plains of Africa, so much the better. But for most people, including me, all this advice isn't terribly helpful.</p>
<p>Taking probiotics is sometimes suggested, but even this is coming under dispute by some researchers. At most it might make a difference for a couple of weeks but once you stop taking them your microbiome will most probably go back to how it was before. Some probiotics may even make any problems with biogenic amines worse because the microbes in them produce biogenic amines as part of their metabolism.</p>
<p>Exercising appears to be good for your microbiome but you should be doing that anyway.</p>
<p>Managing your stress levels and getting enough sleep may be good for your microbiome but you should be doing those things anyway.</p>
<p>Spending some time in nature, such as a walk in a park or in the countryside, or near water, is probably helpful. Getting a dog or borrowing someone else's may help, depending a bit presumably on the dog.</p>
<p>Avoiding anti-microbial medicines such as antibiotics is often cited as beneficial, but if there's a valid medical reason to take them then you should probably do so and if there isn't then you probably shouldn't anyway, regardless of your microbiome.</p>
<p>Regularly eating fermented foods like yoghurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles or kombucha is sometimes recommended on the basis that they contain a lot of microbes that may be able to live in your digestive system and may be beneficial. Some traditional peoples, such as hunter-gatherer-horticulturists, who have very good health, eat small amounts of fermented food. But most store-bought yoghurt doesn't contain any live bacteria. The same is true for sauerkraut if it doesn't state on the label that it is raw (otherwise they pasteurise it and this kills off the very bacteria that may or may not be beneficial). Pickles are often just made with vinegar rather than traditionally fermented I think. Kombucha still contains quite a bit of sugar I think. And no-one really understands what the microbes in these foods do to you, whether they are harmful or beneficial or whether they do anything at all. And all these fermented foods contain high concentrations of biogenic amines. And they might put your microbiome out of balance rather than improve it.</p>
<p>So I don't really know what is best. Personally, I try to eat a variety of different foods including vegetables and fruit (changing with the seasons), beans and whole grains, meat, fish, eggs, butter, cream, olive oil, herbs, spices, bone stock, moderate amounts of alcohol and sometimes small amounts of fermented foods such as 10-20 g of sauerkraut with a meal. It's best to do the fermenting yourself if you can, otherwise make sure you buy raw products. I also try to not eat too much sugar and mostly avoid white flour as I think that these can possibly lead to an imbalance in your microbiome if you eat too much of them.</p>
<p>Hopefully one day scientists will be able to make better suggestions on what is needed for your microbiome. <a name="gut"></a></p>
<h2 id="maintaining-a-healthy-gut-lining">Maintaining a healthy gut lining</h2>
<p>Similar to maintaining a health microbiome, this is an area where scientists have established that it's important but don't have much to say with any certainty about exactly what you need to do.</p>
<p>Maintaining a healthy microbiome is probably the most important thing you can do to keep your gut healthy as the two are closely linked.</p>
<p>Hopefully one day more will be known about how to do this.</p>
<p>Eating a lot of sugar and other refined carbohydrates is almost certainly very bad for your gut lining, as it is for your microbiome, so this should be avoided.</p>
<p>Eating a balanced diet is probably the safest bet for now. I think that a balanced diet should probably include all the following elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Very small amounts of home-fermented vegetables (about 10 grams) at most meals.</li>
<li>Some raw salad leaves e.g. rocket/watercress, about 20 grams a day.</li>
<li>A source of calcium e.g. cooked and softened chicken bones (about 4 grams per day) or dairy products.</li>
<li>Quality fat e.g. goose or duck fat/tallow/olive oil/coconut oil/butter.</li>
<li>A complete protein e.g. meat/fish/seafood/eggs, at least 100 grams cooked weight at most or all meals.</li>
<li>A starchy carbohydrate e.g. oats/brown rice/potatoes, at least 100 grams cooked weight at most or all meals.</li>
<li>Non-starchy vegetables, cooked e.g. red peppers/cauliflower/onions etc etc etc, at least 300 grams raw weight at most meals.</li>
<li>Seasoning, herbs and spices e.g. salt/pepper/curry powder/mixed herbs.</li>
<li>An iodine source e.g. kombu seaweed, about half of a gram of dried seaweed per day, depending on the seaweed.</li>
<li>Some fruit, raw e.g. berries/apple/currants, at least 80 grams raw weight at most meals.</li>
<li>Some nuts or seeds e.g. pistachios, but not much as they can contain a lot of histamine. About 10 grams per day.<br />
<a name="exercise"></a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>I expect you already know that you should be taking some exercise. You don't need to take vast amounts, but you do need to take some.</p>
<p>So much has been written about the benefits of exercise, and it is so squarely part of mainstream theories on health, that I won't repeat advice here that is already widely available. If you really can't find a website that gives advice on exercise, <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/">try the NHS website</a>.</p>
<p>One thing that isn't always mentioned in mainstream advice on exercise is the advice given by the economist Steven Levitt, co-author of Freakonomics. He says that the best form of exercise is the exercise you enjoy. Otherwise you won't keep doing it. Other research has shown that humans only have a limited amount of willpower. Studies have found that if people expend willpower on, say, doing a boring gym workout, they will be less likely to resist some chocolate afterwards compared with control subjects who didn't first do the workout. As this diet requires quite a bit of willpower initially to get into the habit of only eating the foods allowed, expending too much willpower on doing some exercise that you don't really want to do may prevent you from sticking to the diet. But if you can find some exercise that you enjoy and so doesn't use up so much willpower, then that would be good.</p>
<p>If you can't find any exercise that you enjoy, then try racquetball. It's really good fun. You can play it on an ordinary squash court. It doesn't matter if you don't know the rules, you can make them up or use the squash rules. The ball is really bouncy and so quite easy to get back. You don't have to play it competitively - just find a friend and hit the ball around the court without worrying about scoring or who is better. Instead of trying to hit the ball where your opponent can't return it, you can try hitting it where they can, albeit with a bit of effort. If you are very unfit to begin with, take it very slowly until you get fitter.</p>
<p><a name="sun"></a></p>
<h2 id="sun-exposure">Sun exposure</h2>
<p>This is still somewhat controversial and contrary to mainstream health advice. It's not my theory - it's what other scientists have advised. Many highly educated and intelligent scientists support the mainstream advice (which is to avoid unprotected exposure to the sun at all times and at all costs - the 'slip, slop and slap' brigade). Other highly educated and intelligent scientists say that small amounts of exposure to the sun without sunblock is not only safe but actually critical for good health. I have listened to both sides of the argument and have concluded that these latter scientists make more sense. So I follow the rules, set out below, but it's possible that the diet would work without them, I don't know. If you're unhappy about getting some exposure to the sun, then don't do it - it's up to you.</p>
<p>The scientists who advocate small amounts of exposure to the sun argue that we have evolved getting exposure to the sun and we need it for good health. It is known that exposure to the sun enables the body to produce vitamin D. I read that there are about 80 diseases that are statistically associated with low vitamin D levels, including obesity (I can't find the source, sorry). However, taking vitamin D supplements only helps about 20 of them. It is therefore likely that at least some of the other 60 are caused by a lack of some other benefit of sunlight other than the creation of vitamin D. Some other pathways for health benefits of sunlight have been suggested that lead to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290997/#__sec8title">immune system benefits</a> and a reduction in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8935479/">coronary heart disease</a>.</p>
<p>Many scientists also argue that even skin cancer risk is reduced by having small amounts of exposure to the sun. They believe that people who go on sunny holidays and develop a tan gradually without getting sunburnt are less likely to get skin cancer because the darker skin is protective. It's the people who diligently follow the 'slip, slop and slap' protocol who always remain as white as a sheet and then accidentally get caught in the sun and have no natural protection that are at a higher risk of getting skin cancer.</p>
<p>There is also an argument that sunblock itself actually increases the chance of getting skin cancer. The theory is that sunblock doesn't magically cause the UV rays to disappear (energy can't be created or destroyed) - it just converts them to radiation of different wavelengths that don't cause sunburn. But these wavelengths are unnatural - we didn't evolve having to deal with radiation of these wavelengths. (The same is true of the wavelengths of the radiation from sunbeds, which are known to increase the risk of skin cancer.) Some scientists argue that the massive increases in rates of skin cancer over the last few decades actually follows, and is at least partly caused by, the increases in the use of sunblock. Previously, a tiny proportion of people got skin cancer, then the authorities recommended the use of sunblock, then people started using sunblock regularly, then skin cancer became widespread. As rates of skin cancer increased, the recommendations to use sunblock increased and so the use of sunblock increased and so the rates of skin cancer increased further. A vicious cycle.</p>
<p>So the rule I follow about sunblock is that I only wear it if the only alternative is sunburn. Sunburn is definitely very bad for you and sunblock definitely protects against it. But I generally avoid any situation where I might get sunburned - I just stay in the shade. So in a typical year, I won't wear sunblock at any point but I will never get sunburned because the only exposure I have to the sun will be under the very controlled conditions as described further below. This is quite easy living in England where we are blessed, if that's the right word, with plenty of cloud cover year-round. I suppose it would be harder in a sunnier country.</p>
<p>The actual amount of exposure to the sun without sunblock (or moisturising cream which has a similar effect) that is needed for good health isn't well established. Some people say that if you are light-skinned just regularly walking around in a t-shirt will be enough. A study I once read (and can't now find) suggested that there may be little benefit beyond about 10 half-body sunbathing sessions a year of about 20 minutes each. I aim to get more than this though.</p>
<p>People who are non-white often think that they don't need exposure to the sun, and often want to avoid darker skin for aesthetic reasons. However, my view is that non-white people actually need more exposure to the sun than white people, because it takes more sunshine to get the same health benefits.</p>
<p>This is what I do:</p>
<ol>
<li>On a sunny day with a clear blue sky (it does happen in England sometimes), I go sunbathing.</li>
<li>I check the strength of the UV radiation using a little meter I bought on Amazon. You tell it your skin type and it tells you how long you can safely spend in the sun. For me in England, the UV strength on a sunny day is typically 5 and it says I can stay out safely for about 50 minutes. But I will do much less than that even, especially at the start of the year when I am very white - I'll only do about 30 minutes. Towards the end of the summer, when I've developed a bit of a tan, I might go to about 45 minutes.</li>
<li>I split the time into 4 sessions, 2 on my front, 2 on my back and each facing 2 different directions. I generally lie perpendicularly to the sun although I don't think it really matters.</li>
<li>I don't wear any sunblock or moisturising cream.</li>
<li>I sunbathe full body apart from my trunks (I'm usually in a public place like a park).</li>
<li>I try to sunbathe between 11 am and 2 pm when the ratio of UVB to UVA is highest.</li>
<li>I aim to sunbathe for a short enough time that I don't notice any difference whatsoever - certainly no sunburn, but not even any tightness of my skin by the end of the day or any noticeable change in my skin colour. Over the summer, I will become a bit less white, but it will happen so gradually that I will hardly notice. The objective is not to get a tan but to just get some safe exposure to the sun for the health benefits.</li>
<li>I hope to do this around 10 to 15 times a year. It depends on the weather. England doesn't provide that many days with a dependable clear blue sky for most of the day. Rarely more than 20 a year. We have lots of days in the summer with sunny spells but it's harder to sunbathe on those days because the sun keeps going in.</li>
<li>I do enjoy walking and will often walk about in a t-shirt and shorts on a sunny day. But I'm careful to not get too much exposure to the sun. I'll try to walk in the shade or walk early in the morning or later in the afternoon when the sun isn't very strong.</li>
</ol>
<p>I never take vitamin D pills. Firstly, I have no need for them because I believe that I get enough natural exposure to the sun. But also, by not taking vitamin D pills you can then use your vitamin D level (measured in blood tests) as a guide to whether you are getting enough sun. Although there isn't any research to prove this as far as I know, my assumption is that if you are getting enough exposure to the sun to have a good vitamin D level, then you are also probably getting enough exposure to the sun for the other pathways through which the sun brings health benefits.</p>
<p>I also never go on a sunbed. It's well established as far as I know that these are extremely bad for your health. You need the real thing.</p>
<p><a name="tinned"></a></p>
<h2 id="tinnedcannedjarred-foods">Tinned/Canned/Jarred Foods</h2>
<p>No tinned, canned or jarred foods can be eaten on this diet because they all contain potentially high levels of biogenic amines. Canned fish and meat products are particularly bad, but even canned vegetables should be avoided as they still contain some proteins and so still might contain biogenic amines.</p>
<p>Canning/jarring of foods typically involves cooking the food in an airtight environment so that the microbes that cause food to spoil and which can cause food poisoning are killed off. Often you read that all microbes are killed off, but <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/food-science/canning">this isn't the case</a>. I think maybe people write this as a simplification or to mean that all microbes that are known to cause trouble are killed off. The microbes that survive are anaerobic and over time convert some of the amino acids in the protein of the food into amines. Because these amines are created by life forms (the microbes) they are called biogenic amines.</p>
<p>Studies on the biogenic amine content of canned foods have been carried out often by scientists and have shown consistently that they contain much higher levels than in fresh food. Try googling 'biogenic amine content of canned foods' and you'll get lots of results of tests going back decades. The reason it's been studied so many times is that even mainstream science views dietary biogenic amines as harmful, but only at very high concentrations such that people show immediate signs of illness. So there are laws in most countries that concentrations above a certain, very high, amount of biogenic amines in foods aren't allowed. In effect, the mainstream assumption is that very large concentrations of biogenic amines do pass from the digestive system into the blood stream but smaller amounts, that are still very large compared to the amounts we evolved eating, don't pass at all but are fully neutralised in the digestive system. My theory is that these smaller amounts do still pass into the blood stream. I think the problem is that scientists and doctors tend to notice things that make people very unwell very quickly but sometimes ignore things that take years or even decades to have an effect.</p>
<p>For example, I did the above google search and found the article <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282351179_Determination_of_biogenic_amines_in_fish_products">Determination of biogenic amines in fish products</a>. It found that tinned sardine fillets have on average 51 mg/kg of histamine. The legal limit tends to be <a href="https://www.fsai.ie/faq/histamine_fish.html">100 mg/kg</a>, so these have half the legal limit. Let me just repeat what I said above, because really I find it astounding. The mainstream theory is that if you eat a food containing 50 mg/kg of histamine your body will fully neutralise the histamine and none will pass into your bloodstream, whereas if you eat a food containing 100 mg/kg of histamine the histamine will pass into your bloodstream and make you very ill. This binary all-or-nothing approach really seems wrong to me and quite out of line with the more analogue way that the body tends to work.</p>
<p>Freshly caught/slaughtered/harvested foods contains virtually no histamine or other biogenic amines at all.</p>
<p>My theory isn't that the body is completely unable to neutralise biogenic amines under any circumstances but rather that it can only at best neutralise relatively small amounts of biogenic amines that are in foods that we have evolved eating in a form that contain some biogenic amines. So I think it likely that if, for example, you buy fish that has been caught one day ago and stored at just above freezing point, it may have somewhat higher levels of biogenic amines than a fish that has just been caught. But it will also have somewhat higher levels of other products of ageing such as those caused by aerobic microbes. I think that we haven't evolved necessarily eating fish that was cooked and eaten immediately after being caught, but we did always eat fish that was very fresh and in which the aerobic microbes - whose effects we can detect - would have had the same opportunities as the anaerobic microbes. I think it possible that in this circumstance our bodies can recognise that food has some degree of biogenic amines, based on recognising the by-products of the aerobic microbes, and so knows to neutralise them. But with tinned foods, there are no by-products of aerobic microbes, just the by-products of anaerobic microbes, so the body doesn't realise that biogenic amines need to be neutralised.</p>
<p>In any case, whether the above aspect of my theory is right or not, the fact is that we ate fresh foods such as fish bought from a fishmonger that had been caught up to a day or so previously and we didn't have the same problems of chronic illness that have mushroomed over the past few decades. So according to my theory, the very low levels of biogenic amines in these fresh foods are safe. But tinned foods are not.</p>
<p><a name="packaging"></a></p>
<h2 id="foods-kept-fresh-tasting-by-the-packaging">Foods kept fresh-tasting by the packaging.</h2>
<p>Food producers use the packaging of their foods in various ways to keep the food fresh, or at least, to keep it appearing to be fresh.</p>
<p>The main ways are packing the food in a vacuum, packing the food in a 'modified atmosphere' or simply packing the food in an airtight container that didn't have much air in it to begin with.</p>
<p>These techniques keep the food seemingly fresh because they discourage the growth of aerobic microbes. It's the effect of the aerobic microbes which cause the foods to go off in ways that are noticeable to humans. It makes them smell bad, grow mould and discolour (the foods that is, not the humans). But the techniques don't stop the growth of anaerobic microbes. Anaerobic microbes produce biogenic amines as a by-product, which, according to my theory, are harmful. Humans can't detect biogenic amines, possibly because evolution doesn't generally develop unnecessary abilities, and given that we can detect the effects of aerobic microbe growth, and in evolutionary times the two would have always occurred together, it would have been an unnecessary ability.</p>
<p>Also, as I noted in the previous section, I think it possible that the ability that humans do have to neutralise biogenic amines is reliant on the presence of the effects of aerobic microbes as a trigger. If I were Mother Nature looking for the best way to neutralise biogenic amines in the digestive system, I wouldn't do it based directly on the presence of biogenic amines because the body uses biogenic amines itself to regulate digestion. You would end up neutralising your own biogenic amines; an own goal. To ensure that you only neutralise unwanted biogenic amines in food it would make more sense to act based on some other trigger. The effects of aerobic microbes on food would seem like a reasonable way to do this because in normal circumstances aerobic and anaerobic microbes would both have the same chances for development so it should be possible to estimate the amount of biogenic amines (produced by anaerobic microbes) from the amount of some by-product of aerobic microbes. But if the food packaging stops the aerobic microbes but not the anaerobic microbes, in a way that would never have happened during our evolution, then the body is not going to neutralise the biogenic amines correctly.</p>
<p>So any food that is kept supposedly 'fresh' by the packaging is, under this diet, prohibited. Packaging should only hold the food, not preserve it.</p>
<p>Warning signs to look for are packaging that is completely airtight. Packaging with vacuums or a modified atmosphere seem to me to be more rigid - thicker plastic - so this might be a warning sign, I'm not sure. Personally, I try to avoid any airtight packaging but if there's no choice then if the plastic is quite thin and flimsy then I sometimes buy it.</p>
<p>If the packaging says something like 'Once opened, use within x days' then this shows that the packaging is keeping the food fresh and so the food is prohibited.</p>
<p>Even store-bought raw sauerkraut says this, which is surprising because the fermentation of the cabbage should stop it going off even once it's opened, I would have thought. Home-made sauerkraut should last for months or years I think. This is why I think it's best to make your own sauerkraut, but nevertheless, store-bought raw sauerkraut is not forbidden, just not recommended.</p>
<p>Meat and fish that are pre-packed in airtight containers on supermarket shelves are an important part of this prohibition. They may not be eaten on this diet apart from where the exceptions below permit. For example, fish from the fishmonger's counter in supermarkets is usually fresh that day and is kept in the open air at just above freezing. But the pre-packed 'fresh' fish on the supermarket shelves can be stored there at up to 8 degrees centigrade for 10 days. The packaging stops the fish going off, but the anaerobic microbes have plenty of time to produce biogenic amines. The situation with meat is similar. So as mentioned in the notes on meat and fish, you generally should not buy the pre-packed meat and fish on the shelves. It's best to go to the butcher's or fishmonger's section, or to an actual butcher or fishmonger. And when you are there, remember to check that you don't buy anything that has been previously frozen.</p>
<p>The main exception to the above rule is that in some supermarkets with butcher sections, the butchers working there prepare some fresh meat themselves and put it in a package and onto the shelves, with a use-by date attached. So long as you buy the meat from that same day, you can buy it even though it is on the shelf. Ask the butcher for advice as to how to tell the difference in the packaging and what use-by date indicates that the meat is fresh that day.</p>
<p>Another exception is where food on supermarket shelves is pre-cooked and has 6 or more days left until the use-by date; it's probably ok to eat it as the cooking probably happened when the food was fresh and will have killed off quite a lot of the bacteria, and it probably hasn't been sitting on the shelf for very long. So the food probably won't be that high in biogenic amines. Where food on supermarket shelves is raw, 6 days left may still be alright but it would be better to aim for an additional day or two if possible.</p>
<p><a name="ingredients"></a></p>
<h2 id="ingredients-list-no-greater-than-1">Ingredients list no greater than 1</h2>
<p>In general, you should buy raw individual ingredients and prepare your meals yourself in your own kitchen. For example, if you buy some onions, the packaging will just say 'onions' - an ingredients list of 1. This is what you should be aiming for. You can use as many ingredients as you want in your cooking at home, it's the point at which you buy the ingredients that the restriction applies to.</p>
<p>This rule may seem a bit extreme, but there are some exceptions to it.</p>
<p>If salt is the only other ingredient then it's ok, although it's still better to buy a version without salt and then add your own if you can. That way you can use better quality salt, such as traditionally-made sea salt.</p>
<p>If the food has been made freshly in a restaurant from fresh ingredients that comply with this diet, but nevertheless has an ingredients list for some reason, then it's ok.</p>
<p>Freshly made sandwiches, wraps and salads from cafés and shops are sometimes ok too. I wouldn't recommend eating these foods often though because sometimes the meat and fish in them can be high in biogenic amines. It's difficult to tell. And bread is a bit of a borderline food anyway. But once a week might not be harmful.</p>
<p>The shelf life for the above allowed foods from restaurants, cafés and shops should be basically that day only, or maybe one extra day, but you should eat them on the first day.</p>
<p>The danger with other pre-prepared foods made offsite and with longer shelf lives is that they are very likely to be high in biogenic amines. However, pre-cooked foods with a use-by date that is 6 or more days away is generally ok.</p>
<p>Ready meals are forbidden on this diet. Although I suspect there's a lot of variation between supermarkets (Waitrose ready meals may be better, I don't know), ready meals can be very high in biogenic amines. Sometimes the food in them is weeks or even months old. A lot of the ingredients can come from thousands of miles away and can have been stored in frozen form in central warehouses for very long periods. They use these ingredients because it keeps the costs down. By the time the food goes into the ready meal it sometimes has little or no flavour, colour or texture, so all sorts of additives are used to artificially add them back in. But the biogenic amines remain.</p>
<p>If you are absolutely desperate and have no choice but to eat a ready meal, as a one-off occasion, try to find one that doesn't have any E numbers or the words 'extract' (e.g. yeast extract) or 'starch' or anything that you aren't sure what it is on the ingredients list at all. If you have any doubt about the horrors of additives, read Swallow This by Joanna Blythman. She talks of how, following the consumer reaction against E numbers, food producers have tried to 'clean-label' their products, that is, replace E numbers on the ingredients list with something which doesn't sound so bad but could actually be worse. When they say 'yeast extract' they aren't talking about Marmite. I suspect that you can breed yeasts to contain more or less anything you want and extract it from them. And vegetables contain lots of different chemicals that can be extracted. These chemicals are fine altogether in a vegetable in its natural form, but not individually when extracted and purified. E number chemicals were often extracted from vegetables. So 'vegetable extract' is no better. Any 'extract' is unacceptable. At least with E numbers, scientists knew exactly what the chemical was and could investigate its effects, but with these 'extracts' it's harder to know what chemical they are. <a name="frozen"></a></p>
<h2 id="frozen-foods">Frozen Foods</h2>
<p>Any food that has been frozen for more that 2 weeks is prohibited on this diet.</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be any clear scientific evidence one way or the other for frozen foods. Most scientific literature says that freezing 'inhibits' the production of biogenic amines, or that foods can be frozen to 'minimize' the formation of biogenic amines. They almost never say whether freezing stops the formation of biogenic amines altogether or whether it just happens really slowly in frozen foods.</p>
<p>I did find one report that said '<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4921096/">Freezing and frozen storage (−18 °C) will stop the growth of all bacteria and further formation of histamine.</a>', but this was the exception. Another report for example said '<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16260192">freezing can clearly prevent or slow down the process</a>'.</p>
<p>Although not a scientific study, <a href="https://www.histaminintoleranz.ch/en/therapy_cookingadvice.html">this website on histamine intolerance</a> says 'Freezing at –18º C slows down these processes even more strongly but still cannot stop them entirely. Therefore even frozen food should not be stored longer than necessary.' But many other sites on histamine intolerance say that eating frozen food is fine.</p>
<p>It's also hard to find any scientific studies that actually measure the levels of biogenic amines in foods that have been frozen for long periods of time.</p>
<p>Even if, at the temperatures of domestic and supermarket freezers (−18 °C), no biogenic amines are formed, there are a lot of risks. The temperature of the freezer may have risen in the past due to a power cut, faulty equipment or a fraudulent money-saving ploy by the commercial freezing company. And where a food was commercially frozen, you don't know how old it was when initially frozen.</p>
<p>There's a US government site called the <a href="https://www.foodsafety.gov/food-safety-charts/cold-food-storage-charts">Cold Food Storage Chart</a> which recommends quite short freezer storage times relative to what you might expect if there was absolutely no change in frozen foods. Some of the maximum freezer storage times, at −18 °C (0 °F), are as little as 1 month. This suggests that changes can happen in frozen foods over time.</p>
<p>My own personal experience as someone with histamine intolerance is that frozen foods do contain histamine or other biogenic amines. I've tested them myself and consistently reacted to them. I've bought and cooked frozen food from the supermarket several times and reacted to it. On one occasion, I bought some fresh chicken livers, ate half of them straight away and had no reaction at all, chopped up and froze the other half for about a week, then ate them, cooking them straight from frozen (but I cooked them thoroughly). I did react to these.</p>
<p>So while the scientific evidence suggests that frozen food might be ok, it's not clear and my personal experience is otherwise. At least until more is known about them in relation to biogenic amines, they will be prohibited on this diet.</p>
<p>When buying fresh meat or fish at the butcher's or fishmonger's counters of a supermarket, or at a butcher or fishmonger, check whether the food has been previously frozen (and then defrosted). They should be able to tell you. Sometimes it has been, particularly with fish. If it has been previously frozen, it is not allowed on this diet. In general, locally farmed fish has usually not been previously frozen. For example in the UK, UK-farmed salmon and UK-farmed rainbow trout has rarely been previously frozen.</p>
<p>An exception to this rule is sashimi-grade fish, which is previously frozen for a day or so to kill some parasites and make it safer to eat. But it is allowed on this diet. In fact, if you can afford it and have a good local supplier, I recommend buying sashimi-grade fish even if you are going to cook it. You should cook and eat it the same day that you buy it. It undergoes a higher level of careful handling than normal fish and I have never had any reactions to sashimi-grade salmon that I've bought at a reputable fishmonger and cooked the same day. I once reacted to sashimi salmon in the Yo Sushi on Finchley Road, London, but it actually smelt quite strongly (whereas really fresh fish shouldn't smell very strongly) so I don't think that they had stored it properly and I should have sent it back. I never went there again. I've eaten sashimi fish in Yo Sushi many other times in other branches and never had any trouble.</p>
<p>Another exception is liver, which I don't recommend eating from frozen at all, even if you freeze it yourself from fresh and eat it after a week. Even eating it fresh is quite risky as biogenic amines accumulate very fast in liver. Hunter-gatherers traditionally cook and eat the liver of animals immediately after killing them whereas the rest of the animal is taken back home first. I don't know why this is exactly, but I suspect it's because liver is very healthy when eaten fresh but develops biogenic amines so quickly that by the time they got it home it wouldn't be safe to eat.</p>
<p><a name="ripened"></a></p>
<h2 id="artificially-ripened-foods">Artificially ripened foods</h2>
<p>You may not be aware that a great number of fruits and vegetables in the 'fresh' food sections of supermarkets are artificially ripened. Sometimes even the staff in supermarkets haven't heard of it. So let me explain what it is.</p>
<p>In the UK, as an example, normal tomatoes are in season fairly briefly in the summer. But tomatoes are available in supermarkets all year round. The main way that this is achieved is by growing enough tomatoes to meet supply for the whole year, and harvesting enough of them to supply the out-of-season period when they are still green and under-ripe. These under-ripe tomatoes are then kept at low temperatures for months until they are needed. Then they are warmed up and put in an ethylene environment, which causes them to ripen. They then look and taste like an in-season tomato. But during those months of storage, biogenic amines accumulate in them. This is probably the reason that a lot of people find that tomatoes give them a headache.</p>
<p>Mainstream advice to people with histamine intolerance is to avoid tomatoes. But in my opinion this isn't very good advice. Firstly because it's possible to buy tomatoes that are not artificially ripened; these are absolutely fine. And secondly because lots of fruits and vegetables are artificially ripened and so it's far better to learn how to avoid artificially ripened food.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there's no labelling on foods to tell you whether they are artificially ripened or not and the supermarket staff are very unlikely to know. But there are some basic rules you can follow.</p>
<h3 id="local-and-in-season">Local and in-season</h3>
<p>The first rule is that if the food is local and in-season, it is very unlikely to be artificially ripened and so is allowed on this diet. When I say local, I mean from the same country that your are in, or maybe at least the same landmass and within a day or two's transport. So for British people, for example, that would mean grown in Britain. There's a website for British people called <a href="http://www.eattheseasons.co.uk/">eattheseasons</a> which tells you what is in season.</p>
<p>The eattheseasons website has a minor drawback when it comes to estimating whether a locally-grown food is likely to be free of any artificial ripening because it doesn't list all foods which are safe to eat all year round, either because they can be grown in greenhouses all year round or because their storage doesn't seem to give rise to problems with biogenic amines (possibly because we have evolved eating the foods this way).</p>
<p>For the UK, the following vegetables can be eaten all year round (so long as they are from UK sources): broccoli, cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, kale, celery, fennel, french beans, garlic, lettuce, mangetout, mushrooms, onion, potato, rocket/arugula, samphire, shallots, spinach, spring greens/collards.</p>
<p>In fact, there is a variety of tomato available in the UK that can be eaten all year round. Look for on-the-vine organic tomatoes from the Isle of Wight.</p>
<p>In the UK, another good option is to buy your fruit and vegetables from a reputable Farmer's Market. In these, it is generally a requirement that all the fruit and vegetables are local and in-season.</p>
<p>An exception to this rule is that berries (blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries) tend to always be alright even if they are from far away as I think they are flown in by air. So they aren't very good for the environment but they don't contain much histamine and are healthy.</p>
<p>Also, as it can be hard sometimes finding foods from the same country as your are, for practical reasons it's not too bad to buy from a bit further afield, for example I sometimes buy vegetables from Spain and don't have any problems with them.</p>
<h3 id="organic">Organic</h3>
<p>The Soil Association has <a href="https://www.soilassociation.org/media/15883/food-and-drink-standards.pdf">rules on using ethylene</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may use ethylene only:</p>
<ol>
<li>to ripen bananas, kiwis and kakis</li>
<li>to ripen citrus fruit as part of a strategy to prevent fruit fly damage</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to these rules, all organic fruit and vegetables are allowed on this diet, apart from bananas, kiwi fruit, kakis (whatever they are) and citrus fruit. Bananas, kiwi fruit, kakis and citrus fruit are therefore prohibited on this diet unless you are in a country where they are grown locally and are in season.</p>
<p>Also, the organic fruit and vegetables should be in season in the country from which they came.</p>
<p>An exception is aubergine/eggplant which you have to be very careful of. For some reason, biogenic amines form particularly rapidly in these and so even organic aubergines are forbidden if they aren't local. I consistently react to organic aubergines from continental Europe. I really like aubergines but the only time I can eat them is when they are in season in the UK, and even then I try to buy organic.</p>
<p><a name="preparation"></a></p>
<h2 id="foods-created-using-modern-technology">Foods created using modern technology</h2>
<p>New ways to create food using chemical or other industrial processes that have been invented in the last 200 or so years have a poor track record for health in my opinion. They also haven't been eaten by enough people for enough time for scientists to really be able to be sure whether they are harmful or not over the long term.</p>
<p>Any food that has been made with a chemical process or any other artificial process that wouldn't have been widely used 200 or more years ago is forbidden on this diet.</p>
<p>It includes for example anything artificially hydrogenated, chemically-made artificial sweeteners, E-number chemicals, modified starches, vegetable extracts, yeast extracts, chemically-extracted vegetable oils and food powders. <a name="shelf_life"></a></p>
<h2 id="foods-with-a-long-shelf-life">Foods with a long shelf life</h2>
<p>In general, if a food has a long shelf life, then it will probably contain a lot of biogenic amines, and so is forbidden on this diet.</p>
<p>There are exceptions where a food has a long shelf life but biogenic amines don't form, and these are allowed:</p>
<p>Foods which are completely dry are allowed because all microbes need water to live. So flour and dried grains and legumes are allowed (you should eat them within a week of preparing them).</p>
<p>Also pure fats and pure sugar are allowed because microbes can't live on these either. So for example olive oil is allowed even though it has a long shelf life.</p>
<p>Some dry biscuits may be ok, I'm not sure.</p>

<p>I don't really know whether fermented foods are good or bad, but people with histamine intolerance consistently report that they tend to react badly to them, and I sometimes do, so in the absence of any more conclusive evidence, they are not recommended on this diet except in small quantities, or on an occasional basis such as once a week, or as part of a short-term regime to rebuild a damaged gut. Overall, I think it's probably best to avoid them but I do eat them from time to time as I really like some of them.</p>
<p>Fermented foods such as sauerkraut, yogurt, kombucha, kefir, kimchi and pickles are considered healthy by many, but they are very high in biogenic amines. Cheese, chocolate, alcoholic drinks, bread, olives and some mustards are also fermented and may or may not be healthy but tend to be high in biogenic amines.</p>
<p>The health benefit that fermented foods are often credited with is that they contribute to healthy gut microbes, but this is controversial.</p>
<p>Firstly, no one is sure what exactly constitutes healthy gut microbes. A more diverse set of gut microbes is considered to be probably better. A set of gut microbes that is more similar to that of a hunter-gatherer rather than a normal Westerner is considered to be probably better. But the actions and interactions of gut microbes are still so poorly understood that it's very hard to take the results of a gut microbe analysis and say whether it is good or bad. Therefore it is hard to be sure that a set of gut microbes of a person who eats fermented foods regularly is better than that of a person who doesn't.</p>
<p>Secondly, it isn't clear that hunter-gatherers ate fermented foods. No one really knows. They probably didn't though. They probably lacked the equipment to ferment foods themselves.</p>
<p>Thirdly, eating fermented foods, or taking probiotics for that matter, doesn't lead to a permanent change in gut microbes, but at most a short-lived change of probably not more than 2 weeks. So you have to keep eating them to maintain the difference. This means that you have to keep eating foods high in biogenic amines for a benefit that may be an illusion in the first place.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Japanese, as far as I know, do eat small quantities of fermented foods regularly and probably have the best health of any developed nation. Those little sachets of pickled ginger you get with your sushi are possibly an example of the sort of volume of fermented food they might be eating. I think that the Japanese tend to eat very fresh food as well, so this or something else could account for their good health. But in any case, it doesn't seem to be doing them any harm. Westerners have eaten bread and drunk beer and wine for thousands of years and yet health problems such as obesity and other 'diseases of industrialisation' have only really exploded in the last few decades. Note that the bread they ate would have been sourdough bread as commercial yeast wouldn't have been available. And many traditional peoples who had very good health ate some fermented foods. Also, a surprisingly large proportion of centenarians report drinking a small amount of whisky on a daily basis so there may be some health benefits to it (I hope so, I love whisky).</p>
<p>It's possible that our bodies can neutralise small quantities of biogenic amines and that it's just the huge volumes that we are eating nowadays that overwhelm us. This might explain why eating very small quantities of fermented foods is ok. Also, it's possible that fermented foods and drinks that we've been consuming for thousands of years can be neutralised by our bodies so long as they are in a form that our bodies recognise. So traditionally made sourdough bread might be a lot better than modern bread.</p>
<p>Also, the problems caused by inflammation tend to be due to the inflammation being chronic - in other words, from the body being in a constant state of inflammation over a long period. We have evolved to have short periods of inflammation such as when we have an infection. It is where you have inflammation most of the time for decades that the problems really become serious I think. So if you consume fermented foods occasionally, for example once per week, then you will hopefully not be in a state of inflammation most of the time, and so you might be ok. I don't know.</p>
<p>Personally, I do eat some fermented foods because I really like them. I try to eat sourdough bread, traditionally-made mustard in very small quantities and spirits rather than wine or beer as they're lower in biogenic amines. Younger cheeses, such as mild brie, tend to be lower in biogenic amines so I usually choose those over a more mature cheese.</p>
<p><a name="smoked"></a></p>
<h2 id="smoked-foods">Smoked foods</h2>
<p>Smoked foods tend to be high in biogenic amines and are forbidden on this diet.</p>
<p>Smoking is a way of preserving foods, giving them a longer shelf life, but biogenic amines accumulate nonetheless and people with histamine intolerance frequently report that smoked foods cause them problems.</p>
<h2 id="meat-and-fish">Meat and fish</h2>
<p>This is one of the most important parts because biogenic amines grow very quickly in foods high in protein and techniques that supermarkets use to give them a longer shelf life allow biogenic amines to increase yet the food appears to be fresh.</p>
<p>Meat and fish can only come from an actual butcher or fishmonger, or the butcher or fishmonger counter at a supermarket, and where the food hasn't been previously frozen.</p>
<p>The meat and fish available ready-packed on the shelves in supermarkets is forbidden on this diet apart from where the exception noted in the packaging section applies (e.g. pre-cooked food with 6 or more days to go to the use-by date). The packaging stops aerobic bacteria from multiplying and so the food seems fresh. But anaerobic bacteria continue to multiply and produce biogenic amines.</p>
<p>Tinned and frozen meat and fish is prohibited on this diet. Meat and fish bought fresh in accordance with the requirements above can be frozen at home, but must be eaten within 2 weeks, ideally within 1 week.</p>
<p>As noted in the section on freezing foods, liver, while nutritious, is best avoided except on rare occasions, because biogenic amines accumulate really fast in it. It's almost impossible to get it sufficiently fresh in the modern world.</p>
<p>Seafood (e.g. shellfish) also accumulates biogenic amines very quickly. You have to make sure it's fresh that morning, or ideally still alive until just before you cook it (e.g. for oysters, mussels, crab and langoustines sometimes).</p>
<p>Salmon also accumulates biogenic amines very quickly and so ideally salmon should be sashimi grade (you can still cook it).</p>
<h2 id="tomatoes">Tomatoes</h2>
<p>Tomatoes are often listed on sites about histamine intolerance as being foods to avoid. I think that this is because they tend to be ethylene ripened. But it's generally possible to buy tomatoes all year round, at least in Britain, that are not ethylene ripened and are allowed on the diet.</p>
<p>If the tomato is local (e.g. from Britain if you live in Britain) and organic, it should be ok because ethylene ripening isn't allowed for most organic foods. I buy the ones that are small and on the vine and have no problems with them.</p>
<h2 id="rice-and-legumes">Rice and legumes</h2>
<p>Rice and legumes (dried beans and pulses) are allowed, but you must start with them in a dried unprocessed form. It's best to soak them for a few hours or overnight and ideally to sprout them for a day or two.</p>
<p>Easy cook rice is not allowed. It is soaked in hot water for hours, steamed and then dried again before ending up at the supermarket.</p>
<p>Other processed forms aren't allowed, such as tinned, flavoured or other quick-cook variations.</p>
<h2 id="fruit-juice">Fruit juice</h2>
<p>If you squeeze the fruit yourself, and the fruit from which you are squeezing complies with the rules then fruit juice is allowed. Small amounts of lemon juice that you have squeezed yourself or are store-bought (up to 20 grams a day) are also allowed although not particularly recommended. But in general the pre-squeezed juices such as you get in supermarkets are not allowed even if they appear freshly squeezed. Most of these are actually months old. I can't be bothered to go into how they are made here - you can look it up on Google - but it's really shocking.</p>
<p>Juices with a shorter shelf life that separate out on the shelf (with the sediment sinking to the bottom and the top becoming clearer) and that are made from local fruit (such as apple juice in the UK made from UK apples) should in theory be OK, but I've tried them and fairly consistently reacted badly to them, so they are still not allowed. Maybe they use older apples or there's something else going on in the production that they don't tell us about. Possibly the artisan apple juice from farmer's markets might be OK, I don't know. I once got a severe adverse reaction to some orange juice that I bought from a stall in Camden Market where they have a machine that squeezes the juice on site. I was quite surprised, but probably the oranges contained high levels of histamine. Citrus fruits in general are almost always banned on low histamine diets.</p>
<p>So unfortunately, delicious though they are, store-bought juices aren't allowed. There aren't many drinks that are allowed. Water, white or green tea and herbal teas are about it.</p>
<h2 id="alcohol">Alcohol</h2>
<p>Alcohol isn't banned on the diet and I drink it myself in moderation. But this is more because I really like it than because it's safe from a histamine point of view - it isn't. All low histamine diets advise against alcohol.</p>
<p>So alcohol isn't recommended at all.</p>
<p>Clear spirits such as gin, vodka and rum are least harmful, so if you must drink, it's better to stick with these. Whisky isn't too bad either. I tend to drink a clear spirit mixed with a bit of sweet sherry but I try to keep to a small amount and only once in a while.</p>
<h2 id="nuts-and-seeds">Nuts and seeds</h2>
<p>If the nut or seed is in season and local (and for nuts, ideally still in its shell) then it is allowed, otherwise it isn't. For some reason, pistachio nuts are considered OK <a href="https://www.mastzellaktivierung.info/downloads/foodlist/21_FoodList_EN_alphabetic_withCateg.pdf">on this food compatibility list</a> so they may be alright, I don't know.</p>
<p>But in general the packeted nuts or seeds such as those widely available in shops are terrible and are banned on this diet. They contain very large amounts of biogenic amines.</p>
<p>This is an issue as research on Alzheimer's Disease suggests that regularly eating nuts or seeds reduces the chance of getting it.</p>
<p>Seeds from pumpkins, butternut squashes and other winter squashes that you take from the fresh vegetable yourself, roast and eat soon after, are fine and delicious. Also it's worth noting that if you eat tomatoes, courgettes or cucumbers then you are also eating the seeds that are naturally within them, and this is fine too so long as the vegetable is itself compliant with the rules.</p>
<h2 id="chocolate">Chocolate</h2>
<p>Chocolate is really bad unfortunately and isn't allowed on the diet. If I eat it, it makes me ill for a few days. Nevertheless I do eat it sometimes just because I'm quite addicted to it and it's so delicious. I invariably regret it afterwards.</p>
<p>If you must eat chocolate, I would recommend not doing so more than once a month.</p>
<h2 id="always-ok">Always Ok</h2>
<p>Some foods tend to be low enough in biogenic amines that, although if you can get them local, in season and organic this is best, they can nevertheless be eaten year-round even if they come from a bit further afield. They have to be fresh of course in the sense of not being tinned/frozen etc. I eat these very regularly throughout the year and have no problems with them:</p>
<p>Celery<br />
Cucumber<br />
Carrots<br />
Sweet peppers<br />
Cabbage including red cabbage<br />
Lettuce</p>
<p>Packaged fresh salad leaves, such as rocket from Italy packaged in a protective atmosphere and sold in Britain, are also allowed as they still have fairly short shelf lives and don't contain much protein so there's little scope for developing a lot of biogenic amines.</p>
<p>Root vegetables including potatoes, swede, celeriac and turnips, are also allowed year-round. They are often stored for significant periods as far as I understand it, but this is an agricultural technique that has been done for thousands of years and so I think that we have adapted to it and so our bodies are able to neutralise the biogenic amines.</p>
<p>Winter squashes such as pumpkins and butternut squashes that are in season are also allowed even if they aren't organic and are from a bit further away (e.g. from continental Europe if you are British) because, like root vegetables, I think we are adapted to them being stored for slightly longer periods.</p>

<h2 id="the-3-day-test">The 3-Day Test</h2>
<p>If you are interested in trying this diet, you could try The 3-Day Test.</p>
<p>To do this, eat only the foods and drink only the drinks that are in <a href="#very_safe">the list of very safe foods</a>.</p>
<p>Do it for 3 days. By the end of the 3 days and the morning of the 4th day, look for changes depending on what the problems were that you might have been having due to biogenic amines. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are overweight, by the end of the 3 days you should be feeling less lethargic and less hungry than normal.</li>
<li>If you have trouble with your circadian rhythm, such as feeling very sleepy during the day and not being able to sleep at night, you should sleep much better on the third night.</li>
<li>If you have restless legs syndrome, you should not get it on the third night.</li>
<li>If you get headaches a lot, they should have improved.</li>
<li>If you have problems with your digestion such as recurrent belly ache, this should have improved.</li>
<li>If you have problems with itchy skin, this should have improved.</li>
<li>If you normally have to get up several times during the night to go to the loo, you should be able to sleep through the third night.</li>
<li>If you've been having unexplained anxiety or depression, you should start to feel a bit happier.</li>
<li>If you've been suffering from unexplained fatigue, you should start to feel a bit more lively and cheerful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that even if you do see an improvement, it could be due to 'reversion to mean', that is, it might have improved anyway. But you could consider continuing with the test a bit longer and see how it goes. I'd be interested to hear from you in any case.</p>
<p><a name="very_safe"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-list-of-very-safe-foods">The List of Very Safe Foods</h2>
<p>The following foods are particularly safe to eat. The rules still apply about them needing to be fresh (they can't be tinned, frozen, pickled, packed in a protective or sealed environment, vacuum-packed, preserved, ethylene ripened (so they should be local, in-season and ideally organic), dried (apart from grains, sugar, herbs and spices), pre-cooked or pre-processed). See the <a href="#practice">practice</a> and <a href="#fresh_rules">fresh rules</a> sections of this document for more details).</p>
<p>They are suitable for the 3-day test.</p>
<p>The list is based on my own experience, <a href="https://www.mastzellaktivierung.info/downloads/foodlist/21_FoodList_EN_alphabetic_withCateg.pdf">this food compatibility list</a> and <a href="https://www.food-intolerance-network.com/food-intolerances/histamine-intolerance/histamine-intolerance-hit-tolerated-foods-list.html">this survey data</a>.</p>
<p>Note that The Fresh Food Diet is by no means limited to just these foods. Any foods complying with the rules are allowed. These are just particularly safe foods. These foods could be used as the starting point for an elimination diet. Start with just these foods and then try introducing other foods (still following the rules for The Fresh Food Diet) and see if they cause any issues.</p>
