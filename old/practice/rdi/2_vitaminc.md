The recommended daily intake (RDI) in the [UK is 40 mg per day](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-c/) and in the [US it is 90 mg](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/). So if I go on holiday to the US, do I need to get more than twice the amount of vitamin C in my diet while I'm there? Of course not. US RDIs do tend to be far higher than any other country. I don't know why this is. Perhaps the supplement industry lobbies more aggressively in the US. The US website above does state that the RDI is 'much higher than the amount required for protection from deficiency'.
[16 countries](http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/food/8F044e/8F044E07.htm) have a RDI of 30 mg per day, as does the [World Health Organisation](https://www.nap.edu/read/6009/chapter/4#20).

The [British Medical Journal](https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-gb/632) says that 'Scurvy may be prevented with as little as 6.5 mg vitamin C daily'.

The UK site also says that vitamin C cannot be stored in the body so you need it in your diet every day. However, according to [Live Science](https://www.livescience.com/28984-hunger-strike.html), hunger strikers can go without food altogether for a month before there are any permanent complications to their health. Also, scurvy, [takes at least a month of little or no vitamin C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scurvy) to set in. So in my view, the body has a much greater capacity to buffer micronutrients, including vitamin C, than is generally recognised.

That said, I think that vitamin C is unquestionably important, but people living in developed countries eating a balanced diet including some fruit are unlikely to be deficient.

For people on a tight budget, the cheapest food sources of vitamin C, based on a theoretical annual cost of getting 40 mg per day (just to aid comparison), are cauliflower (£52), spring greens/collards (£70), lemon juice (£88) and potatoes (£ 120). Apples come in at a pricier £1140 but I think it's a good idea to eat fresh fruit anyway if you can possibly afford it.   
Just to explain the numbers, in case you are confused: if you spent £52 on cauliflower you would buy about 30.2 kg of it (based on the price in Morrison's supermarket in the UK in 2019). 30.2 kg of cauliflower would contain about 14.6 g of vitamin C which is equal to roughly 365 days * 40 mg. The actual numbers per food would vary depending on where you live and the time of year. It's just an approximate way to compare the cost of vitamin C for different foods - I'm not suggesting you should ever buy all that cauliflower and eat it all at once. The daily RDI for vitamin C can be obtained from about 90 g of cauliflower (raw weight) at a cost of 16p.

Personally, I aim for at least the 40 mg level but usually get much more. As vitamin C is gradually destroyed by cooking, I try to get some in the form of raw fruit. I eat more in the summer than in the winter as there are more fruits in season then. I'm also partial to lemon juice as part of hot toddies, which I drink from time to time whether I have a cold or not, as I like them.
