## Foods created using modern technology

New ways to create food using chemical or other industrial processes that have been invented in the last 200 or so years have a poor track record for health in my opinion. They also haven't been eaten by enough people for enough time for scientists to really be able to be sure whether they are harmful or not over the long term.

Any food that has been made with a chemical process or any other artificial process that wouldn't have been widely used 200 or more years ago is forbidden on this diet. 

It includes for example anything artificially hydrogenated, chemically-made artificial sweeteners, E-number chemicals, modified starches, vegetable extracts, yeast extracts, chemically-extracted vegetable oils and food powders.
