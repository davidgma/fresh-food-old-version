## Cats

I once saw a veterinary website (which unfortunately I can no longer find) that showed that cats have seen an increase in the so-called diseases of industrialization on more-or-less the same scale and in more-or-less the same time frames as humans. Obesity, heart disease and cancers for example have increased in cats in much the same way as in humans. 

It could be a coincidence that both humans and cats went for tens of thousands of years without these problems and then suddenly started having them at the same time but for completely different reasons. But it seems more likely to me that the causes for both are the same. 

If so, it could be considered quite helpful in narrowing down the causes of the increase in chronic disease because cats eat a much narrower range of foods. They basically eat meat and not much else. They don't tend to even like sugar.  

The only real difference in the diet of cats is that they've gone from eating fresh meat from a butcher to eating tinned meat. Tinned meat most likely contains high levels of biogenic amines whereas fresh meat generally wouldn't. 

The manufacturers of tinned meat will certainly try to produce a product that cats will find compelling, so the theory of addictive/compelling food is quite plausible too. But the issue with this theory in my opinion is that it isn't very clear where the inflammation is coming from: if a food isn't inflammatory in small quantities, why would it be inflammatory in large quantities? Whereas the inflammatory nature of biogenic amines is very clear and well understood.  

So I think that the most likely explanation for the increase in chronic diseases in cats is the biogenic amines in tinned cat food.
