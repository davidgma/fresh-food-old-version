## Nuts and seeds

If the nut or seed is in season and local (and for nuts, ideally still in its shell) then it is allowed, otherwise it isn't. For some reason, pistachio nuts are considered OK [on this food compatibility list][foodcompat] so they may be alright, I don't know.

But in general the packeted nuts or seeds such as those widely available in shops are terrible and are banned on this diet. They contain very large amounts of biogenic amines.

This is an issue as research on Alzheimer's Disease suggests that regularly eating nuts or seeds reduces the chance of getting it. 

Seeds from pumpkins, butternut squashes and other winter squashes that you take from the fresh vegetable yourself, roast and eat soon after, are fine and delicious. Also it's worth noting that if you eat tomatoes, courgettes or cucumbers then you are also eating the seeds that are naturally within them, and this is fine too so long as the vegetable is itself compliant with the rules.
