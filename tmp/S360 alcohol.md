## Alcohol

Alcohol isn't banned on the diet and I drink it myself in moderation. But this is more because I really like it than because it's safe from a histamine point of view - it isn't. All low histamine diets advise against alcohol. 

So alcohol isn't recommended at all.

Clear spirits such as gin, vodka and rum are least harmful, so if you must drink, it's better to stick with these. Whisky isn't too bad either. I tend to drink a clear spirit mixed with a bit of sweet sherry but I try to keep to a small amount and only once in a while.
