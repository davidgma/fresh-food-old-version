## The 3-Day Test

If you are interested in trying this diet, you could try The 3-Day Test.

To do this, eat only the foods and drink only the drinks that are in [the list of very safe foods][very_safe].

Do it for 3 days. By the end of the 3 days and the morning of the 4th day, look for changes depending on what the problems were that you might have been having due to biogenic amines. For example:

- If you are overweight, by the end of the 3 days you should be feeling less lethargic and less hungry than normal.
- If you have trouble with your circadian rhythm, such as feeling very sleepy during the day and not being able to sleep at night, you should sleep much better on the third night.
- If you have restless legs syndrome, you should not get it on the third night.
- If you get headaches a lot, they should have improved.
- If you have problems with your digestion such as recurrent belly ache, this should have improved.
- If you have problems with itchy skin, this should have improved.
- If you normally have to get up several times during the night to go to the loo, you should be able to sleep through the third night.

Note that even if you do see an improvement, it could be due to 'reversion to mean', that is, it might have improved anyway. But you could consider continuing with the test a bit longer and see how it goes. I'd be interested to hear from you in any case.
