## Occam's Razor

Occam's Razor is a philosophical principal that says that the explanation that requires the fewest assumptions is usually correct.

Most, if not all, of the so-called diseases of industrialisation, can be explained by just one assumption: that where a food contains biogenic amines in a quantity that is much higher than that which that food would have traditionally contained, the body does not fully stop those biogenic amines from passing into the blood stream.

Biogenic amines have such an extensive signalling role within the body, including causing inflamation and regulating bone formation, sleeping, digestion and cognition, that an enormous range of diseases could be explained by this one assumption.

So although Occam's Razor isn't a proof that my theory is right, it does suggest that it may well be.
