## Foods with a long shelf life

In general, if a food has a long shelf life, then it will probably contain a lot of biogenic amines, and so is forbidden on this diet.

There are exceptions where a food has a long shelf life but biogenic amines don't form, and these are allowed:

Foods which are completely dry are allowed because all microbes need water to live. So flour and dried grains and legumes are allowed (you should eat them within a week of preparing them).

Also pure fats and pure sugar are allowed because microbes can't live on these either. So for example olive oil is allowed even though it has a long shelf life.

Some dry biscuits may be ok, I'm not sure.
