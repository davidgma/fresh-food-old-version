## Rice and legumes

Rice and legumes (dried beans and pulses) are allowed, but you must start with them in a dried unprocessed form. It's best to soak them for a few hours or overnight and ideally to sprout them for a day or two.

Easy cook rice is not allowed. It is soaked in hot water for hours, steamed and then dried again before ending up at the supermarket.

Other processed forms aren't allowed, such as tinned, flavoured or other quick-cook variations.
