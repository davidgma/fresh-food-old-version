      <description>It is a fundamental part of this diet that sufficient micronutrients must be consumed. But exactly how much of each micronutrient is needed is a lot less clear-cut than you might think. On the one hand, some doctors pooh-pooh the idea that a healthy person in the developed world could be deficient in any micronutrient at all. On the other hand the US government recommends daily intakes that are generally far higher than those of other countries&amp;rsquo; governments.</description>

      <description>The recommended daily intake (RDI) in the UK is 40 mg per day and in the US it is 90 mg. So if I go on holiday to the US, do I need to get more than twice the amount of vitamin C in my diet while I&amp;rsquo;m there? Of course not. US RDIs do tend to be far higher than any other country. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why this is. Perhaps the supplement industry lobbies more aggressively in the US.</description>
