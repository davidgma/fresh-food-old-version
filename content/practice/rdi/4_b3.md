The recommended daily intake for vitamin B3 is 16.5 mg in the UK and 16 mg in the US. The Linus Pauling Institute suggests that [12 mg may be enough](https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/niacin#daily-recommended-intakes). The [NHS site](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-b/) says 'You should be able to get all the niacin you need from your daily diet'. This is particularly true because the body [can convert the amino acid tryptophan into vitamin B3](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Niacin-HealthProfessional/) at the ratio of 60 mg of tryptophan to 1 mg of vitamin B3. So as long as you're eating a balanced diet including protein it seems unlikely that you will be deficient.

Nutrient-tracking software, at least the one I use - [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com) - doesn't take into account the conversion from tryptophan, so if it shows a deficiency, but you have some extra tryptophan then it's likely that you will be meeting the recommended amount.
