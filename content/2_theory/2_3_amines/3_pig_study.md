There was also a [study of pigs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3134804) where they gave some pigs a dose of histamine and some of the pigs also were given a substance to block their production of DAO. DAO is what pigs (and humans) naturally produce to neutralise biogenic amines such as histamine in their digestive systems to stop it going into their bloodstreams. The pigs with the blocked DAO production had severely raised levels of histamine in their blood. Although this isn't in itself surprising, the authors noted that 20% of humans eat or drink things that similarly block DAO production and so they suggested that histamine from food getting into the bloodstream in humans is likely to be a problem.

Both this pig study and the human study discussed previously are very small and so you can't draw very solid conclusions from them. But I couldn't find any other studies on the subject. 

My estimate of 60% to 100% of humans being unable to stop biogenic amines in food from getting into their bloodstreams comes from these studies so it's really a very wild guess. The 60% is made up of the 50% of humans that had reactions to the histamine in the human study, plus 20% of the remaining 50% who might be taking DOA inhibiting substances. 

The 100% is based on the possibility that no humans can stop all biogenic amines getting into their blood streams and the reason that the 50% in the human study didn't show any reaction is that the histamine molecules all attached to cells whose response couldn't be felt, such as cells in the heart and artery walls and cells in osteoclasts.

I also think that it is possible that the length of time that humans have been consuming the specific foods with biogenic amines matters. For example, if you hang beef for a few days prior to eating it then it becomes more tender apparently. This is a practice that is done today and could easily have been done for thousands of years. It's not rocket science to hang an animal from a tree after killing it. There is some evidence that humans do produce DAO on eating beef and beef is one of the foods best tolerated by people with histamine intolerance. So I think that it's possible that we've evolved to produce DAO on eating beef whereas if we eat, for example, a ready meal that is full of biogenic amines then we don't produce enough DAO because the body isn't expecting it to contain biogenic amines.
