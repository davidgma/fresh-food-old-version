<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This is a diet based on a combination of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Several fairly widely-accepted, although not exactly mainstream, concepts about the recent rise of obesity and other chronic illnesses.</li>
<li>An entirely unproven theory of my own about biogenic amines that I've never heard anyone else suggest. It is contrary to mainstream theory.</li>
</ol>
<p>It mainly involves eating fresh food, but what constitutes fresh is quite strict - some foods considered fresh by many people are forbidden.</p>
<p>It does not involve going hungry - it is not a calorie-controlled diet; you can eat as much as you like. But it does require self-discipline, at least initially, because for most people it probably involves a complete change of eating habits, more difficultly shopping, more time spent cooking and the foregoing of many compelling foods.</p>
<p>It also involves various other behaviours which I consider healthy.</p>
<p>I personally follow this diet and it seems to work for me. According to my genetic analysis on the website <a href="https://www.23andme.com">23andMe.com</a>, I am predisposed to weigh 190 pounds (86kg, 13 stone 8) whereas I actually weigh 150 pounds (68kg, 10 stone 10). According to an MRI scan I have zero detectable calcified plaque in my heart and arteries, and my blood test levels for inflammation are always low.</p>
<p>Whether it works for anyone else or not - I don't know. But I wanted to set out my diet in case anyone else wants to try it or might find it interesting. But if anyone does, please note <a href="#disclaimer">The Mother Of All Disclaimers</a>.</p>
<p>Also, it is a low histamine/low biogenic amine diet, so anyone who, like me, has histamine intolerance, may find it interesting.</p>

<h2 id="the-main-diet-rules">The Main Diet Rules</h2>
<p>These are the main rules to follow for the diet.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#micronutrients">Ensure you get all the required micronutrients in your diet.</a></li>
<li><a href="#compulsive">Avoid foods that cause compulsive eating</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#microbiome">Maintain a healthy microbiome</a>.</li>
<li>Eat only foods that are genuinely fresh, <a href="#fresh_rules">as defined in this diet</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#exercise">Get enough exercise</a>.</li>
<li>Get some exposure to the sun at least a few times during the year at a safe level but without sunblock or moisturiser.</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="fresh_rules"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-fresh-food-rules">The Fresh Food Rules</h2>
<p>These are the rules for what counts as genuinely fresh food. More details are given further down (at least they hopefully will be - this is work-in-progress), including many exceptions to the rules.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tinned/canned/jarred foods are forbidden.</li>
<li>Foods that are kept fresh by the packaging, such as using a modified atmosphere, are forbidden.</li>
<li>Pre-packaged foods with an ingredients list of more than 1 item are forbidden (e.g. ready meals).</li>
<li>Foods that have been frozen for more than 2 weeks are forbidden.</li>
<li>Artificially ripened foods are forbidden. In practice this means that foods must be either (i) local and in-season, or (ii) organic, from a country that is fairly close and in-season in that country.</li>
<li>Foods that require a preparation process that has only become available within the last 200 years are forbidden.</li>
<li>Foods with a shelf life of more than a month, except where they are completely dry, or are entirely either fat or sugar, are forbidden.</li>
<li>Fermented foods are forbidden except in small quantities.</li>
<li>Smoked foods are forbidden.</li>
<li>Everything else is allowed.</li>
</ol>
<p>It may seem like hardly anything is allowed on the diet, but that is really more of a reflection of the state the world has got to where only processed and long-life foods are eaten.</p>
<p>You can eat fresh in-season fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, shellfish, eggs, butter, cream, home-made bone stock, grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, olive oil, coconut oil, herbs, spices and seaweed. You can eat small amounts of pickles or sauerkraut at any meal. You can eat at restaurants where they cook local in-season food from fresh. Sugar, particularly brown sugar or molasses, in moderation is allowed so you can eat home-made desserts. People ate these foods quite happily for thousands of years until recently and the enormous diversity of world cuisines evolved from eating only these foods.</p>
<h1 id="theory">Theory</h1>
<p>This section sets out the theories behind the main diet rules and the fresh food rules.</p>
<p>You don't need to read any of this if you aren't interested. You can skip to the practical details further down.</p>
<p>In the past 200 or so years, and especially in the past 40 years, there has been a huge increase in certain diseases. They broadly fit into the following categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some cancers</li>
<li>Cardiovascular diseases (e.g. heart disease and stroke)</li>
<li>Metabolic syndrome diseases (e.g. weight gain, obesity, diabetes)</li>
<li>Autoimmune diseases</li>
<li>Cognitive diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's Disease)</li>
<li>Neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g. eating disorders, schizophrenia, depression)</li>
</ol>
<p>These diseases are sometimes collectively called the 'diseases of industrialization'. Many of them could equally well be called the diseases of inflammation as chronic inflammation is common to many of them.</p>
<p>Researchers have been trying to work out why this has happened, and they are still not sure. All that is known for sure is that we went from eating fresh, local, in-season produce, prepared in our own kitchens, to eating food with long shelf lives that have been produced and prepared elsewhere. Most researchers, as far as I can tell, agree that some aspects of this have caused the problems. But no one really knows exactly what the aspects are, advice on what to do has been astoundingly unsuccessful and there isn't really a very good explanation for exactly what is causing the chronic inflammation.</p>
<p>My theory is that the chronic inflammation, as well as various other problems, are caused by dietary biogenic amines passing from the digestive system into the bloodstream. This is contrary to mainstream theory which says that dietary biogenic amines are fully neutralised in the digestive system.</p>
<h2 id="biogenic-amines---my-theory">Biogenic Amines - My Theory</h2>
<p>So my theory, and it is only a theory, is that dietary biogenic amines pass from the digestive system into the bloodstream in between 60% and 100% of people, and not <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/85/5/1185/4633007">1%</a> as is the mainstream view.</p>
<p>This might seem like a minor detail of no real significance, but in fact it is hugely significant. If this theory is true, everything changes. The vast majority of foods available in a typical supermarket, including foods currently considered healthy, would instead be considered unhealthy and would probably end up being banned by governments. The entire processed food industry would be under threat. There would be an additional and major plausible explanation for the surge in chronic disease over the last 40 years or so and an additional and powerful course of action available to those who care about their health.</p>
<p>Given the significance of this point, I think that it is surprising that, as far as I can tell, it has rarely been studied. I could only find 2 very small studies about it on Pubmed (a repository of scientific studies). These, taken together, suggest that biogenic amines do pass into the bloodstream in between 60% and 100% of people.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<h2 id="histamine-intolerance">Histamine Intolerance</h2>
<p>Let me start with an overview of histamine intolerance - a condition I personally suffer from - because it sets out what is accepted by the mainstream scientists and doctors.</p>
<p>Histamine intolerance is an officially-recognised condition that is based on the following 3 accepted facts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Many modern foods, unlike those eaten by our ancestors, contain relatively large quantities of histamine and other so-called 'biogenic amines' - molecules that are used internally as a signalling chemical for various purposes by many species including humans. The majority of methods that allow foods to have a longer shelf life and be available out of season cause biogenic amines to be created in the foods. The biogenic amines are created as a by-product of microbial activity and increase over time; when the food is first harvested/killed it contains negligible quantities of biogenic amines.</li>
<li>If the histamine and other biogenic amines were to pass from the foods in our digestive systems into the blood stream, it would be expected to cause health issues because various parts of the body would respond to their signalling effects but the signalling would be unwanted because it had come from foods and not from the body's own signalling mechanisms. Biogenic amines are known to be involved in stimulating inflammation, pulling calcium out of bones, regulating the sleep-wake cycle, mediating neuronal signalling and regulating digestion.</li>
<li>The digestive system neutralizes the biogenic amines with a chemical called DAO so that they do not pass into the blood stream and do not cause these signalling problems. But in 1% of people, this neutralization process is inadequate and biogenic amines do pass into the bloodstream and do cause signalling problems and corresponding health problems. This 1% of people are said to have histamine intolerance.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is this final part that is wrong according to my theory. It is instead between 60% and 100% of people that cannot neutralize all of the biogenic amines in food and this leads to a large variety of potential health problems including chronic inflammation, calcium metabolism disorders, digestive disorders and sleep disorders. Chronic inflammation then contributes strongly to one or more of: weight gain, heart disease, cancer, auto-immune diseases and cognitive diseases.</p>
<h2 id="the-human-study">The Human study</h2>
<p>Given the enormous repercussions should it be the case that biogenic amines in food do pass into the bloodstream of most people, it is surprisingly hard to find any evidence one way or the other. It doesn't seem to have been studied much.</p>
<p>I suspect this is because, as only about 1% of people show symptoms of histamine intolerance, it is simply assumed that everyone else is able to fully neutralize biogenic amines. But as biogenic amines attach to cells in the body (this is how they carry out their signalling function) it is possible that in most people the biogenic amines get attached to cells in the heart, arteries and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2671373/">osteoclasts</a> or other receptors, such that the person doesn't feel anything but nevertheless in time develops diseases. It is well-established that chronic inflammation is associated with a wide range of diseases but people developing these diseases do not feel the inflammation. For example, the accumulation of plaque in people's arteries is associated with chronic inflammation yet people do not feel at all unwell until, after decades of plaque accumulation, they have a heart attack. They do not feel the inflammation. That's why people have blood tests to test for inflammation - if they could feel it they wouldn't need the test. So biogenic amines could plausibly be passing into the blood stream of most people without them feeling unwell, depending on which cells the biogenic amines mainly attached to.</p>
<p>If this were the case then histamine intolerance would probably be better characterised as a predisposition in some people for the biogenic amines to attach to receptors that produce noticeable short-term problems rather than problems that are unnoticeable in the short and medium term.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15603203">One study</a> did test whether histamine, at a normal level found in food, passed into normal people's bloodstreams. It only looked at 10 people unfortunately (plus 10 controls) so is too small a study to draw any concrete conclusions from, but it found that in 5 of the 10 people the histamine did appear to have passed into their bloodstreams as they had noticeable reactions to it whereas none of the controls had any reaction. So this 50% of the sample does massively contradict the mainstream view that only 1% of people can't fully neutralize dietary biogenic amines.</p>
<p>An interesting thing to note from this study is that none of the blood tests taken from the subjects (presumably taken from the arm) showed any raised histamine level, even in the subjects that had a noticeable histamine reaction. This suggests that all the molecules of histamine that did get into the bloodstream had attached to a cell receptor before the blood got to the arm. This might offer another explanation of why the mainstream view is that only 1% of people can't fully neutralize the dietary biogenic amines - any studies conducted by giving subjects a dose of histamine and then looking for changes in blood levels of histamine would find no raised histamine level and then conclude that there was no histamine passing into the bloodstream.</p>
<h2 id="the-pig-study">The Pig study</h2>
<p>There was also a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3134804">study of pigs</a> where they gave some pigs a dose of histamine and some of the pigs also were given a substance to block their production of DAO. DAO is what pigs (and humans) naturally produce to neutralise biogenic amines such as histamine in their digestive systems to stop it going into their bloodstreams.</p>
<p>When I say that humans are able to produce DAO it may seem that I am contradicting my theory. However, my theory is that humans are only able to neutralise biogenic amines in foods that they have evolved eating in a form that contains biogenic amines, such as red meat that has been hung for several days or small quantities of fermented foods. In general, I don't think humans evolved eating many foods that contain biogenic amines because they evolved eating fresh local in-season food. Domestic pigs on the other hand, have in effect evolved (via selective breading by humans) to eat pig swill, which is basically old human food, which would have contained a lot of biogenic amines, and so I think that pigs are naturally far better at neutralising biogenic amines than humans.</p>
<p>The pigs with the blocked DAO production had severely raised levels of histamine in their blood. Although this isn't in itself surprising, the authors noted that 20% of humans eat or drink things that similarly block DAO production and so they suggested that histamine from food getting into the bloodstream in humans is likely to be a problem.</p>
<p>Both this pig study and the human study discussed previously are very small and so you can't draw very solid conclusions from them. But I couldn't find any other studies on the subject.</p>
<p>My estimate of 60% to 100% of humans being unable to stop biogenic amines in food from getting into their bloodstreams comes from these studies so it's really a very wild guess. The 60% is made up of the 50% of humans that had reactions to the histamine in the human study, plus 20% of the remaining 50% who might be taking DOA inhibiting substances.</p>
<p>The 100% is based on the possibility that no humans can stop all biogenic amines getting into their blood streams and the reason that the 50% in the human study didn't show any reaction is that the histamine molecules all attached to cells whose response couldn't be felt, such as cells in the heart and artery walls and cells in osteoclasts.</p>
<h2 id="the-book-trace-amines-and-neurological-disorders">The book 'Trace Amines and Neurological Disorders'</h2>
<p>There is actually a book that has been published called 'Trace Amines and Neurological Disorders: Potential Mechanisms and Risk Factors' by Tahira Farooqui and Akhlaq A. Farooqui which also indirectly supports my theory.</p>
<p>They weren't looking at the diseases of industrialisation in general, but neurological disorders in particular. I haven't read the book, but there are some extracts of it available on the internet. Here are some of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...in a diverse array of human pathologies ranging from substance abuse, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, schizophrenia, and other neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, the levels of trace amines are unusually high with an imbalance in their functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Biogenic amines have been shown to occur in various foods like fish, meat, cheese, vegetables, and wines.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...Biogenic amines may thus enter the bloodstream postprandially.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So they are basically saying that in people with the various diseases they list, they have unusually high levels of biogenic amines in their body and they suspect that these higher levels come from eating foods that are high in biogenic amines.</p>
<p>The reason that I think that the findings can be applicable beyond just neurological disorders is that biogenic amines can potentially attach to a very wide range of cells in the body, and the exact cells that the molecules attach to will determine the disease. Studies have shown that even in a particular individual, the cells that histamine molecules attach to can vary from one day to another. So I don't think it is unreasonable to assume that different individuals may have different predispositions for which cells biogenic amines will attach to.</p>
<p>For example, if biogenic amine molecules tend to attach themselves to histamine receptors in an artery, it might trigger inflammation. Over a period of regularly eating foods high in biogenic amines, the person might get heart disease. Similarly, if the molecules tend to attach to osteoclast receptors, they might end up with osteoporosis. Similarly, if they tend to attach to cell receptors in blood vessels in the head they might end up getting headaches. If they tend to attach to cell receptors that regulate the circadian rhythm then they might end up with sleep disorders. And so on. They might also get a combination of diseases where more than one type of cell receptor is attached to.</p>
<h2 id="broken-mechanisms">Broken Mechanisms</h2>
<p>In my opinion, most or all of the 'diseases of industrialisation' can be viewed as failures of mechanisms in our bodies rather than mainly the result of an external cause. This is more a way of looking at things rather than a new theory in itself.</p>
<p>The mainstream approach seems to be to treat all diseases as the result of an external cause, perhaps because, before the diseases of industrialisation, this was probably almost always the case. For example, if a person is bitten by a mosquito that passes on the parasite that causes malaria, then that parasite is the external cause of the malaria. Whether the person survives will depend on whether their immune systems can defeat the parasite.</p>
<p>However, I don't think that the diseases of industrialisation fit well into this paradigm. Our species, homo sapiens, has been around for about 200,000 to 300,000 years and it's probably only been in the last few hundred that these diseases have existed in anything other than negligible amounts and only in the last 40 or so years that they have really mushroomed.</p>
<p>The external environment has changed, but it doesn't seem to me to have changed enough to explain the rise of these diseases. The explanation that seems better to me is that mechanisms in our bodies that used to stop these diseases from ever happening have stopped working. We have broken our natural mechanisms.</p>
<p>For example, I believe that we have a natural mechanism to stop us from becoming fat. The argument that some put forward that we have evolved to put on as much weight as possible when there's enough food so as to survive in a famine does not, in my opinion, stand up at all to scrutiny. The argument is called 'the thrifty gene hypothesis' and has been very widely discredited. Instead, many experts say that we evolved in an environment with few humans and plenty of resources that our ancestors were very adept at using. Scientists studying hunter gathers reckon that it probably only took them 2 or 3 days of work a week to get all the food they needed and famines would have been rare. The Economist magazine says that famines only happen when both a natural disaster and bad government occur together. I doubt that any hunter gatherer chiefs, however bad, would have been able to contribute to a famine - they just wouldn't have had enough influence over the environment. The idea that humans have only had enough food to eat in the last 40 years, and that's why many have become so fat, doesn't even tie up with living memory. I remember 40 years ago, when almost no-one was that fat, and there was a huge middle class in Britain that had enough food to eat and didn't get fat.</p>
<p>Whereas not being fat would have been advantageous to our ancestors as it would have helped with hunting, gathering, running from wild animals and fending off rival humans. So I think it likely that we evolved to have a natural mechanism to stop us getting fat. Our appetite plays a role in this mechanism as does how energetic we feel.</p>
<p>So it seems more likely to me that where people have not stayed slim, it's because they have broken this mechanism. The answer is not to try to starve themselves when they feel ravenous and force themselves to exercise when they feel completely lethargic, because it takes more will power than people have over the long term. The answer is to fix the mechanism so that the body will naturally become slimmer by being less hungry and feeling more energetic. The person will be working with their body rather than against it.</p>
<p>It is my theory that a significant contributing factor to breaking this mechanism is chronic inflammation caused by dietary biogenic amines passing into the blood stream. I have noticed that when I have a cold I always feel hungrier and more lethargic than normal and I invariably put on weight. But then I lose that weight again very easily on recovering from the cold. It makes sense to me that when the body is under attack from a parasite it should go into a state of inflammation and take on more calories to give its immune system the best chance of defeating the parasite. So it seems likely to me that when the body is in a state of inflammation, it will naturally want to take on more calories. The problem with today's diet of foods containing biogenic amines, according to my theory, is that people have a state of permanent inflammation and so they permanently put on weight. By changing to a diet low in biogenic amines they might be able to end their chronic inflammation and their bodies might naturally lose weight as they will feel less hungry and more energetic for a time until their weight has reduced again. For a person of a healthy weight, eating extra calories will not lead to weight gain but rather to not feeling hungry for longer or feeling more energetic.</p>
<p>Another example is that of heart disease. The mainstream efforts to address this problem seem to involve looking for external causes. The idea seems to be that something external is causing problematic plaque deposits to form in the heart and arteries. Saturated fat has been suggested as a factor. However, many doctors and scientists who have studied this put up very compelling arguments as to why saturated fat is not a cause of heart disease. But what no one seems to be considering is the notion that plaques forming in the heart and arteries is completely normal and has always happened, but throughout most of human existence the body simply removed them again. What has changed might instead be that we have broken the mechanism that removes the plaques so that they keep accumulating and end up causing heart disease and strokes.</p>
<p>Here's my layman's view of inflammation and removal of debris within the body. Imagine you are bitten by a mosquito. It doesn't carry the parasite that causes malaria so you're not in any serious danger. Soon after the bite, the site of the bite swells up and becomes itchy. This is a reaction of the body to try to fight a possible infection that might arise because of the bite. The inflammation of the area helps to stop the spread of any parasites that might have been introduced. It's intentionally created by the body and the body achieves this by the release of histamine, a biogenic amine, at the local site. It may be annoying, but it's a good thing. Over the next few days, the body's immune system will go to work to make the area safe, killing any parasites it can. Once the site is safe, the swelling comes down and then, over the next few days, the site is restored to normal and looks exactly the same as before the bite happened. It seems likely to me that this final step would involve removing any debris from the site such as the immune cells that were active there. It wouldn't make sense to reduce the inflammation until the site is safe and it wouldn't make sense to remove the debris until the site is safe, so it seems plausible to me that the body would naturally not remove debris from an internal site until any inflammation has subsided.</p>
<p>My theory is that dietary biogenic amines pass into the blood stream and can attach to receptor cells in the heart and arteries and cause inflammation. Because this happens after most meals, the inflammation is chronic - it's there almost all the time for decades. So perhaps, because of the chronic inflammation, the body's natural mechanism for clearing any plaques from the heart and arteries holds off doing so, waiting for the inflammation to subside. But it never does.</p>
<h1 id="practice">Practice</h1>
<p>This is still work in progress but will hopefully eventually provide help as to what is allowed and what is prohibited on this diet.</p>
<p><a name="micronutrients"></a></p>
<h2 id="micronutrients">Micronutrients</h2>
<p>Getting all your required micronutrients is part of this diet. As part of my broken mechanism approach to understanding diseases of industrialisation, is seems plausible to me that all of the body's mechanisms will need the basic building blocks of micronutrients to work properly. In any case, it is clear that getting sufficient micronutrients is necessary for good health.</p>
<p>In general, if you are eating a balanced diet containing at least vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, and eggs, I think it likely that you will be ok. But it's a good idea to, from time to time, weigh and record everything you eat in nutrition software. I use <a href="https://cronometer.com/">cronometer</a> which is free, but there are many choices. By doing this you can get a better idea of whether or not your diet is covering all the necessary nutrients.</p>
<p>One nutrient that generally isn't covered in nutrition software but is very important is iodine. Some studies have suggested that iodine deficiency is a widespread problem even in developed countries like Britain. I think it's a good idea to include some arame dried seaweed in your diet. I add a small amount to soups - just a few shreds, maybe 0.1g. There is a danger of taking in too much iodine, although some scientists say that this is only an issue from artificial sources of iodine, such as pills, and that you can eat seaweed without any danger. I don't know, you may want to do some research, but about 0.1g of arame dried seaweed no more than once a day is what I do. You can use other seaweeds but it's worth checking on the internet how much iodine they contain. Some, like the nori seaweed used to make sushi, contains almost none while others can contain a huge amount.</p>
<p><a name="compulsive"></a></p>
<h2 id="compulsive-foods">Compulsive Foods</h2>
<p>There is a theory that is becoming increasingly accepted amongst obesity researchers that a significant contributing factor to the rise in levels of obesity is that foods have become more compulsive. That is, we feel a desire to eat them beyond what is necessary to provide enough calories to live. I think this theory is almost certainly right and so it forms part of the diet.</p>
<p>The idea is that as we have moved away from eating foods that were prepared in our own kitchens and instead have started to eat mostly foods that have been prepared commercially, such as ready meals, fast food and confectionery, the provision of these foods has become a competitive business. To succeed in a competitive environment, food producers have had to design their products to make them as desirable as possible. Intentionally or unintentionally, they have created foods that are, in effect, addictive. We feel compelled to eat them even when we aren't hungry. Imagine you are walking along the road and you aren't that hungry. Someone suggests to you that you might like to eat a salad. You say, "Well, actually I'm not that hungry." But if someone suggests to you that you might like some pizza, you suddenly feel a desire to eat it.</p>
<p>So we've ended up eating when we aren't hungry and so we've overridden the mechanism that would otherwise stop us eating when we had no need for the additional calories. So we've become fat.</p>
<p>I think that this theory alone could explain the rise in obesity without needing my theory about biogenic amines at all. The main aspect where I think my theory is better is that the compulsive foods theory doesn't provide a clear mechanism for creating chronic inflammation and doesn't explain all the other chronic illnesses that have become widespread over the last few decades. Whereas mine does. But I think that both are important factors.</p>
<p>Some proponents of this theory of compulsive foods talk of 'highly palatable foods' as the problem, and have sometimes adopted a policy of only eating bland and unappetising foods in order to stay slim. They equate foods that taste really nice with foods that are compulsive. I don't agree with this at all and it is absolutely not a requirement of this diet to eat bland foods.</p>
<p>I have the good fortune of having a father who is a brilliant cook. He was a restaurateur, running a restaurant that produced mainly French provincial-style cuisine (but in England). I grew up eating amazing food. I ate at the restaurant whenever I wanted to. Being the boss' son, I just showed up and asked for whatever I wanted and my father or one of the lovely chefs there would produce it. At home, my father did the cooking and his food was always delicious. For our holidays we would go on tours of France, armed with a copy of the Michelin guide, and we would visit some of the best restaurants in France. In my opinion, the French food I grew up eating tastes far nicer than any fast food hamburger, fried chicken or pizza. I wouldn't go as far as to say it tasted better than chocolate. But the interesting thing was that I never had a craving for my father's food, or any other French food, when I wasn't hungry. If my father offered me some food and I wasn't hungry, I would just say that I wasn't hungry. But I got the same cravings for junk food as anyone else. Despite the availability of amazing French food, I'm ashamed to say that I regularly ate junk food.</p>
<p>So food compulsion is not about taste in my opinion. It's about craving. My father's food tasted far better but I never craved it.</p>
<p>This diet bans the eating of foods that are compulsive, apart from perhaps very occasionally. But the test of whether a food is compulsive or not isn't based on how good it tastes. It is based on whether you have a desire for that food when you are not hungry. If you are walking down the road and you see a pizza shop and you feel an urge for some pizza, ask yourself whether you would also eat a salad or some other home-cooked food. If you find foods that you fancy eating when you aren't in the mood for eating healthy foods then you should conclude that that food is compulsive. Having concluded this, I think that it is better to, generally, never eat those foods, even when you are genuinely hungry. It is better to get over the addiction. A food should not be compulsive. Proper food, in my opinion, is desirable when you are hungry and not when you are not.</p>

<h2 id="maintaining-a-healthy-microbiome">Maintaining a healthy microbiome</h2>
<p>Your microbiome is the set of microbes such as bacteria and yeast that co-exist with you - mainly in your digestive system but also on your skin, in your mouth, up your nose etc. Research on this subject has been mushrooming recently and the findings are that your microbiome is incredibly important for your health.</p>
<p>For example, there is compelling evidence that your microbes effect your weight. There have been experiments where they took microbes from the guts of thin mice and put them into the guts of fat mice and the fat mice became a lot thinner. There is also compelling evidence that your microbes effect your brain functioning, your immune system, your digestive system and provide vital nutrients to your body.</p>
<p>As a result of all this research, advice to maintain a healthy microbiome has now become fairly mainstream. Unfortunately, the research has yet to come up with much in the way of helpful recommendations on how to do this. So I've included this requirement as part of the diet more in the hope that one day it will be clearer what needs to be done rather than because there's much that can be done about it with any certainty now.</p>
<p>It is clear from the research that, to have a healthy microbiome, it is a good idea to be born naturally rather than by a caesarian delivery, it is good to be fed breast milk rather than formula as a baby and to avoid having your appendix removed. If you can live as a hunter-gather on the plains of Africa, so much the better. But for most people, including me, all this advice isn't terribly helpful.</p>
<p>Taking probiotics is sometimes suggested, but even this is coming under dispute by some researchers. At most it might make a difference for a couple of weeks but once you stop taking them your microbiome will most probably go back to how it was before. Some probiotics may even make any problems with biogenic amines worse because the microbes in them produce biogenic amines as part of their metabolism.</p>
<p>Exercising appears to be good for your microbiome but you should be doing that anyway.</p>
<p>Managing your stress levels and getting enough sleep may be good for your microbiome but you should be doing those things anyway.</p>
<p>Spending some time in nature, such as a walk in a park or in the countryside, is probably helpful. Getting a dog or borrowing someone else's may help, depending a bit presumably on the dog.</p>
<p>Avoiding anti-microbial medicines such as antibiotics is often cited as beneficial, but if there's a valid medical reason to take them then you should probably do so and if there isn't then you probably shouldn't anyway, regardless of your microbiome.</p>
<p>Regularly eating fermented foods like yoghurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, pickles or kombucha is sometimes recommended on the basis that they contain a lot of microbes that may be able to live in your digestive system and may be beneficial. Some traditional peoples, such as hunter-gatherer-horticulturists, who have very good health, eat small amounts of fermented food. But most store-bought yoghurt doesn't contain any live bacteria. The same is true for sauerkraut if it doesn't state on the label that it is raw (otherwise they pasteurise it and this kills off the very bacteria that may or may not be beneficial). Pickles are often just made with vinegar rather than traditionally fermented I think. Kombucha still contains quite a bit of sugar I think. And no-one really understands what the microbes in these foods do to you, whether they are harmful or beneficial or whether they do anything at all. And all these fermented foods contain high concentrations of biogenic amines. And they might put your microbiome out of balance rather than improve it.</p>
<p>So I don't really know what is best. Personally, I try to eat a variety of different foods including vegetables and fruit (changing with the seasons), sprouted beans and grains, meat, fish, eggs, butter, cream, olive oil, herbs, spices, bone stock, moderate amounts of alcohol and sometimes small amounts of fermented foods such as 10-20 g of sauerkraut with a meal. It's best to do the fermenting yourself if you can, otherwise make sure you buy raw products. I also try to not eat too much sugar and mostly avoid white flour as I think that these can possibly lead to an imbalance in your microbiome if you eat too much of them.</p>
<p>Hopefully one day scientists will be able to make better suggestions on what is needed for your microbiome. <a name="exercise"></a></p>
<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>I expect you already know that you should be taking some exercise. You don't need to take vast amounts, but you do need to take some.</p>
<p>So much has been written about the benefits of exercise, and it is so squarely part of mainstream theories on health, that I won't repeat advice here that is already widely available. If you really can't find a website that gives advice on exercise, <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/">try the NHS website</a>.</p>
<p>One thing that isn't always mentioned in mainstream advice on exercise is the advice given by the economist Steven Levitt, co-author of Freakonomics. He says that the best form of exercise is the exercise you enjoy. Otherwise you won't keep doing it. Other research has shown that humans only have a limited amount of willpower. Studies have found that if people expend willpower on, say, doing a boring gym workout, they will be less likely to resist some chocolate afterwards compared with control subjects who didn't first do the workout. As this diet requires quite a bit of willpower initially to get into the habit of only eating the foods allowed, expending too much willpower on doing some exercise that you don't really want to do may prevent you from sticking to the diet. But if you can find some exercise that you enjoy and so doesn't use up so much willpower, then that would be good.</p>
<p>If you can't find any exercise that you enjoy, then try racquetball. It's really good fun. You can play it on an ordinary squash court. It doesn't matter if you don't know the rules, you can make them up or use the squash rules. The ball is really bouncy and so quite easy to get back. You don't have to play it competitively - just find a friend and hit the ball around the court without worrying about scoring or who is better. Instead of trying to hit the ball where your opponent can't return it, you can try hitting it where they can, albeit with a bit of effort. If you are very unfit to begin with, take it very slowly until you get fitter.</p>
<h2 id="meat-and-fish">Meat and fish</h2>
<p>This is one of the most important parts because biogenic amines grow very quickly in foods high in protein and techniques that supermarkets use to give them a longer shelf life allow biogenic amines to increase yet the food appears to be fresh.</p>
<p>Meat and fish can only come from an actual butcher or fishmonger, or the butcher or fishmonger counter at a supermarket, and where the food hasn't been previously frozen.</p>
<p>The meat and fish available ready-packed on the shelves in supermarkets is forbidden on this diet. The packaging stops aerobic bacteria from multiplying and so the food seems fresh. But anaerobic bacteria continue to multiply and produce biogenic amines.</p>
<p>Tinned and frozen meat and fish is prohibited on this diet. It is well-established by scientific studies that these foods can be high in biogenic amines. Meat and fish bought fresh in accordance with the requirements above can be frozen at home, but must be eaten within 2 weeks, ideally within 1 week.</p>
<p>Liver, while nutritious, is best avoided, because biogenic amines accumulate really fast in it. Traditional hunter-gathers actually cook and eat the liver immediately on killing the animal. It's almost impossible to get it sufficiently fresh in the modern world.</p>
<p>Seafood (e.g. shellfish) also accumulates biogenic amines very quickly. You have to make sure it's fresh that morning, or ideally still alive (e.g. for oysters, mussels, crab and langoustines sometimes).</p>
